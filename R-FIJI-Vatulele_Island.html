<P>The world of tropical travel has been so buffeted by advertising hype,

for most of our adult memories, that travel shoppers go glassy-eyed when

they see another wobbly phrase like &quot;world-class reefs&quot; or &quot;Polynesian

Paradise&quot; popping up in dive travel or scuba diving magazines. That's why it is almost impossible

to laud a tropical getaway isle as magnificent as Vatulele Island (pronounced Vah-too-LAY-lay)

without wrinkling the eyebrows of wary vacation seekers. But we're going

to try anyway. After all, Mount Everest need not apologize for its stature,

nor Papua New Guinea for its wild highland purity, nor the central Indonesian archipelago 

for its hypnotic coral colors.  There are no 5-star luxury Fiji resorts to compare with Vatulele Island, not a one, friends. 

Vatulele is in a category of prime tasteful luxury that's completely unique among South Pacific islands.</P>


<P>In like manner, folks who've tasted the rare fruit of Vatulele Island Resort in the Fiji Islands,  need

not apologize for, nor pretend to downplay, the enchantment of their South Pacific adventure.

Our clients &amp; contract associates who have reviewed Vatulele Island Resort -- among scores of such luxury tropical islands -- 

believe that this particular secluded isle, which is 7 miles long &amp; 3 miles

wide, shaped like a left footprint, &amp; sitting 30 miles south of Viti

Levu's Coral Coast, is truly one of the world's best &amp; brightest tropical vacation 

destinations. For scuba divers, this may be the best luxury dive resort in the Polynesian SoPac.  For snorkelers or easygoing beach baskers, this island is a stunning departure from the ho-hum tourist locales of Hawaii & the Caribbean.  For obvious reasons, Vatulele Island Resort is not for everyone seeking luxury tropical islands. This place

exists solely to cater to, to satisfy &amp; to delight, only a select echelon

of the world's most discriminating travelers, &amp; aficionados of the

South Pacific Ocean's most memorable scuba diving & snorkeling vistas.  Dive vacations simply do not 

come in a prettier more tantalizing package, anywhere on this Big Blue Planet, among countless hundreds of luxury tropical islands, we believe.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0"> 

<P><B>FUN FACT for FIJI DIVING enthusiasts:</B>

</font>

Vatulele Island Resort is also one of very few 5-star luxury island getaway in the Pacific with its own on-island PADI 5-star scuba diving center.  This place caters to Fiji scuba diving needs with first-class finesse & experience.  These guides are experts to the max.  You will be in good hands from Day One, & they will show you why Fiji is rated by us, & many of the professional U/W photographers & videographers with whom we work, as one of the top 3 or 4 destinations anywhere in the Pacific for healthy vivid soft corals.

This tropical island resort features 17 identical seaside villas, plus 2 special ultra-luxury villas (one at each extreme end of a 900-meter-long sandy beach).  Each meticulously  

appointed villa is expertly built with custom yellow-matte-finished walls &amp; wooden shutters, plus

high-ceilinged Fijian-style thatched roofs. Each Vatulele villa is a gem, set back a bit into

the green Fiji Islands jungle canopy, with a splendid view of surf &amp; sunsets. You'll

have your own private stretch of beach, plus a spacious sitting room, a

bedroom with a king-sized bed &amp; a separate dressing room. Your large

private bathroom is in a connecting wing of the villa. All areas of the Vatulele Island 

villas open into a large shaded terrace, a must-have feature on luxury tropical islands. </P>



<P>There's nothing like Vatulele Island Resort in all of the magical Fiji Islands,

nor anywhere in the South Pacific, many tropical travel experts would contend. A

bona fide 5-star property, where so many lesser locales only pretend to be, Vatulele has been hailed by Gourmet magazine

as &quot;the creation of perfectionists.&quot; This is the only luxury dive resort in the Fiji Islands, indeed anywhere 

among all Pacific islands, to once have been listed with the prestigious Relais &amp;

Chateaux, an association of hotels that adhere to the finest standards

of lodging amenities, haute-cuisine &amp; attentive service in the global travel industry. 

Relais & Chateaux is IT, folks, the <I>sine qua non</I> of luxury resort rankings.</P>

In June 2001, Travel & Leisure magazine, one of the world's most respected arbiters of taste in international travel, ranked 
Vatulele Resort as #1 in "World's Best Service" for all of Australia, New Zealand & the South Pacific.  Travel & Leisure in that 
same Pacific region, in March 2001, ranked Vatulele Island Resort as "World's Best-Value Hotel."<P>

<P>What's more, Conde Nast Traveler, in a number of widely-read issues, has listed

Vatulele Island Resort as one of the top 10 &quot;almost perfect&quot;

resorts in the world. Conde Nast Traveler has some august company, as well.  

Travel writers in Great Britain have loved this place:

Harpers &amp; Queen ranks Vatulele Island Resort among &quot;the top 100 hotels in the

world,&quot; while the Tatler places it among &quot;the top 50 hotels in

the world.&quot; One critic in the London Daily Telegraph wrote, &quot;Vatulele Island 

is the best tropical resort I have seen anywhere in the world.&quot; Meanwhile,

back in the U.S., Vogue magazine said, &quot;Vatulele Island is a resort against

which (we) will judge all others.&quot; These critics are simply stating

fact, not advertising hype. Vatulele Island Resort has set a standard of impeccable service &amp; physical

comfort that few dive resorts, or South Pacific luxury tropical islands of any kind, ever could hope to match. 

Yet while you're there,

neither staff nor management at Vatulele puts on any airs. You'll feel as casual &amp;

comfortable moving about the island -- a truly breezy Polynesian vibe -- as you would at a dinner in a South Pacific family

member's home.</P>



<P>The nightly dive package rates at Vatulele Island Resort include your own private ocean-front

villa next to a long white-sand beach, plus all meals &amp; all beverages

except alcohol, plus all dive resort activities

except scuba diving &amp; game fishing. Your scuba vacation package basically

gives you everything but a backrub &amp; the secret of enlightenment. This

ultra-luxury South Pacific island resort operates its own private air strip &amp; island hopper air service

from Nadi International Airport on the main island, Viti Levu. Vatulele Island 

is about 20 water miles south of Viti Levu, &amp; 30 minutes by air from

Nadi. And Nadi is an easy day's hop of 3,174 air miles southwest from Honolulu.  As luxury Fiji resorts go, this 
little extra commuter time is WELL worth it, oh Polynesian sunseekers.</P>



<P>The gentle, warm waters of Vatulele Island's lagoon are perfect for safe &amp;

relaxing snorkeling adventures. If you want deeper thrills, the scuba diving

outside the reef rim is replete with acres of colorful corals &amp; abundant

fish life enough to dazzle even Fiji diving veterans. And the scuba diving prices

are so affordable you'll be tempted to grab tank after tank each day. Just

be careful of your nitrogen uptake. You don't want to get tagged by the joint-fizzies in Fiji,

after all.  Fiji diving is SO good, you could get hooked on huffing compressed air. 

Fiji diving will make you a believer, that satori can be achieved in this earthly sphere.  

Fiji diving is a spiritual visual experience as much as a relaxing sport.  Fiji diving is the <I>sine qua non </I>of 

South Pacific scuba adventures.  Or as Grandma used to say, "The cat's pajamas !"<BR>

<P>The vision of Vatulele Island Resort's founders, award-winning Aussie TV producer

Henry Crawford &amp; Martin Livingston, was to create a South Pacific island getaway

so perfect that men &amp; women whose high-intensity jobs have abraded

them with stress, can grab a plane, a suitcase &amp; a daydream, then escape

-- not just a little -- but completely, exultantly, resoundingly from the

world's worries. We know of only one vacation hide-away more remote &amp;

exotic -- Jupiter -- but weather can be a snarlin' bear out there, &amp; the airfares

are a bit steep, unless you've got an inside track with NASA.</P>



<P>If you're a seasoned globetrotter, maybe even an experienced visitor to Fiji, 
who's beginning to feel the gloom

of Alexander the Great after he sliced the Gordian Knot -- all your kingdoms

have been conquered, your eyes are veiled in a &quot;been-there-done-that&quot;

shade of jade, you've lost hope in finding a dive vacation adventure you haven't already

sampled -- well take a good hard look. You haven't seen it all in the South Pacific yet, amigo. Not

a chance.  Try the Pride of the Fiji islands.  Try Vatulele Island Resort.</P>



<P>No money transactions are permitted on Vatulele Island. Don't even think

of tipping the staff. We must alert you that such a move would be a <I>faux pas extraordinaire</I> 

in Fiji, where tipping is essentialy taboo. (We find this is one cultural norm that produces surprisingly little controversy 
among travelers :) Of course you can leave a couple hundred bucks for the village school fund, or the Christmas bonus fund, if the Spirit moves you; no worries on that score.  There are

no TVs, no radios, no newspapers, no tourist traps, no discos.  NO HASSLES AT ALL!

Just clean Fiji air, perfect water, crystal sands, gracious people &amp; sunshine.

Daytime meals on Vatulele Island are offered on a terrace overlooking the lagoon. Evening

meals are under the stars, lit by lanterns &amp; candles. All Vatulele Island Resort meals are

gourmet quality &amp; prepared by the finest native chefs, with fresh ocean

provender &amp; healthful tropical fruits &amp; vegetables.  The meals we have relished here seem more 

like <i>haute art</i> than mere victuals.</P>



<P>Now for the <i>piece de resistance,</i> the part when we get to chat about Fiji scuba diving.  

Vatulele Island's northern &amp; eastern coastlines are rimmed by a fringing coral 

reef that in some places is right next to shore, &amp; some places more

than a mile away. More than 60% of the island's land area is dominated

by virgin jungle that has not felt the impact of civilization. There is

no heavy industry, no highways, no development apart from the resort, only

four little villages along the eastern flank, where about 900 people live

in healthy South Pacific serenity.  This is one reason why Fiji scuba diving in this Vatulele sector 

is so prisine: no vessel pollution, no siltation, no runoff, few of the problems of the touristy isles.  

We dream almost every day of moving to an island like this, some day 

when the demands of work abate.  Fiji scuba diving experiences have changed us, big time.  The corals are healthy despite global warming having bleached many of the SoPac's once lustrous reefs.  We saw hundreds of brilliant fish species just 300-400 meters from shore, & had some heart-starting adventures with schooling reef sharks out on Turtle Mountain.  The scuba diving & snorkeling on Vatulele are a bona fide lucid dream, folks. The critters are electric with sheer color, & always bountifully in your face wherever you turn.  Plus dive guide Vuli got a brand-new diving boat recently, a clean swift little beauty.</P>

<BR><BR>




<P>But there's more to Fiji scuba diving adventures than the scuba diving, of course.  

Most of Vatulele Island Resort's staff have been trained from among the island's

villagers, who still maintain the peaceful &amp; ingenuous spirit that

sets old-world Fiji apart from all other South Pacific & Polynesian cultures. Vatulele Island natives

live by fishing &amp; farming. They also are one of Fiji's main centers

for production of the beautiful Tapa wall-hangings. Tapas are mulberry-bark

paper covered with ancient Fijian symbols &amp; designs traced in natural dyes indigenous to Fiji.

We have brought many of them back with us from the South Pacifc &amp; we still treasure them as 

delightful mementos of our Fiji scuba diving experiences.</P>



<P>Devout Methodists, the Vatulele islanders do not drink alcohol, but they enjoy

an occasional sip of the traditional Fijian grog known as <i>yaqona</i> (pronounced

Yahn-GO-nah), or kava.  This spicy cold tea made from the powdered roots of regular pepper plants. When

new guests visit a village, they seek a blessing for their arrival by presenting

the island's main chief with a gift of premium kava root, a cherished gift

anywhere in the Fiji Islands, even among native rulers.  If you like the chief a lot, you give him a 5 or 7-year-old kava 

root, & he will beam as broadly as the Somosomo Strait.  If you give him an 8 or 9-year-old root, you will make a 

friend for life.  And he may insist on you sharing some of that heavenly grog, until your lips & brain are tingling & your limbs 

feel like biiiiigggggg deeeep treeeee rooooooots.  Oh yes.  (BTW: no worries.  Kava is perfectly legal to import into 

the U.S., do you won't be some sort of beverage outlaw if you partake of the Relaxo-Root.)  

But one Dutch Uncle word to the wise:  do not mix Fiji scuba diving with too much grog, it might affect your safety 

on the decom side of things, OK?  Sure thing amigos del mar.  </P>



<P>Another plus of Fiji diving is the abundant sealife, some of which is munchable.

Vatulele Island is renowned for its big, succulent red prawns, which thrive

in tidal pools below ancient cliffs inscribed with 3,000-year-old petroglyphs.

Among other great Vatulele Island hikes are recently discovered caves inland, which

harbor pools of cool clear water ideal for swimming to escape the hot midday

sun. Here you can beat the heat in an instant by taking a dive on the wild

side.</P>



<P>Children under age 12 are not allowed on Vatulele Island, except during special

&quot;Family Weeks&quot; a couple times a year. During these times, the

children keep to earlier meal hours &amp; do not join the adult tables.

Baby-sitters are easily secured & they are very reliable nannies.</P>



<P>If there is anything at this wonderful South Pacific dive resort that has been left to

chance, we challenge you to find it. Only a handful of luxury tropical islands 

on Earth can rival the sheer elegance &amp; purity of Vatulele Island Resort.

This is the kind of place where you'll find true rest for your soul &amp;

true inspiration for your heart. The pampering of your body is, well, only

natural here at Vatulele Resort in Fiji. </P>



<P>One good tip to remember about packing for Vatulele Resort: pack super light!

The resort wants guests to pack less than 35 lbs in their main bag, plus

keep their carry-on as light &amp; compact as possible. This is because

the commuter airplane from Nadi to Vatulele Island is small &amp; has tight

weight limits.  Please adhere to this stricture, or you may be required to ditch some bags in Nadi, leaving them 

for your return flight home.  Thank you for your consideration.<BR><BR>

VATULELE ISLAND PRICES: for all Fiji scuba diving & Fiji snorkeling trips:</font></font>

Just to give you an exciting perspective on how Vatulele's new management team is easing up on prices, during shoulder season, prices of these luxury deluxe bures (cabanas) from about 2005 through 2007 used to run USD $1576 per couple, per night, while the Vale Viqi Villa (honeymoon pink house)&nbsp;= USD $2197 per night & the breath-taking Point Villa = USD $3117 per night.  During high season (July 1 thru Oct. 31, & Dec. 24 thru Jan. 10) prices for these same room categories rose to USD $1875, then $2496,  then $3450 per night.  Then in 2008 & 2009 the rates, driven by world economic variables, ebbed a bit to the afore-mentioned rack prices that preceeded this current special.  Final conclusion of U.S. DIVE TRAVEL owners is that Vatulele Island Resort ranks solidly among the top 5-star ultra-luxury beach resorts anywhere in the Pacific Region, mainly due to superior service, delightful amenities & exceptionally modest prices that nearly come in at 4-star rack rates.<BR>



<P>All dive packages include meals &amp; locally purified water, plus a private beachfront villa, plus free

run of resort activities such as tennis, sailing, hiking, paddling, volleyball

&amp; land yachting. There is even a well-stocked library of classic volumes. The minimum 

stay is four nights. Each villa is designed mainly for couples, but solo

vacationers are welcome as well. No children under 12 years old are allowed on Vatulele Island 

most of the year.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><B><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT>

<P>All Fiji snorkeling & Fiji diving prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. 
Lodging, side tour & diving prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. 
Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard per FAA rules. 
We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; & that has been our pledge for one decade now.  
Our tropical vacation experts normally secure excellent wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to 
secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated all U.S.-based airlines, 
so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals.  Early is good when seeking the best air ticket rates for your 
Fiji snorkeling & Fiji diving adventures.</P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above scuba diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, 
in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. As with most Fiji snorkeling & Fiji diving packages, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. 
Some exceptions will be noted. International air tickets & commuter "island-hopper" seats are always extra above these land costs. 
Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets & the vessel + side tour components of your Fiji snorkeling & Fiji diving vacations. 
The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $45 per person for the land portion + $35 pp for the air tickets. 
Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. 
Solo clients sometimes pay a single supplement to secure a private room -- normally 35% or more than the standard 
double-occupancy rate at some dive resorts.</P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for all of our dive resorts, side tours & air ticket specials is by cashier's check or wire transfer in 
U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer only. 
No personal checks will be accepted for the land or air portions of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. 
Our service level is the highest & our prices the lowest in this industry, & thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin on your 
Fiji snorkeling & Fiji diving vacation packages. 
For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa & Mastercard. For ultra-discount wholesale air tickets, 
USDT accepts only cashier's checks or wire transfers, please.</P>

<P>Remember, all tropical vacation clients on all Fiji snorkeling & Fiji diving vacations will be asked by local officials overseas, 
upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $25 - $40 per client. 
USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. 
Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; & 
away you go. Best of luck with your dive travel plans. We hope your sFiji snorkeling or Fiji diving vacation is a safe & satisfying adventure. 
Blessings & best wishes with ALL your dive vacations.</P>

<P>Best fishes too!</P>
