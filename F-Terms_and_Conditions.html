FORM: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Throughout this document, U.S. Dive Travel 
hereafter will be referred to as &quot;<B>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">USDT</FONT></B>.&quot;
Also hereafter in this document, the term &quot;dive trip&quot; will mean
all vacation packages (including scuba trips, snorkeling trips, eco-tours
&amp; other non-diving side tours) that USDT sells to a client to take
on his or her own schedule. &quot;Dive trip&quot; also will mean all vacation
packages for which USDT provides a staff guide to accompany the clients
overseas on any special group tour.
<P>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
<B> For all dive trips &amp; vacation packages,
USDT requires a minimum non-refundable $900 deposit per person for resort-based 
vacations, or a minimum non-refundable $1,200 per person deposit for live-aboard vessel trips, 
plus all tariffs or service fees paid up front.  Cancellations are allowed for 
certain emergencies, only as specified below.</B></font>
<P>
This deposit is to be received by USDT no later than 7 days after
the client's written commitment to book the trip. Clients may commit in
writing by E-mail. USDT will begin a formal booking, &amp; secure
a client’s reservations overseas, only after the client submits a brief
written request for the booking, specifying names of all travelers (exactly
as written on passports) + dates of travel + services needed + contact
phone &amp; fax numbers &amp; e-mail addresses of all clients. USDT has
a simple booking-request form for this purpose, to help you organize the
facts, which we will e-mail to you any time.
<P>

USDT may require land deposits
to be higher than the normal $900 per person, or live-aboard deposits to be higher than 
$1,200 per person, for certain customized,
labor-intensive vacation bookings to remote areas, or for other special high-end tours. 
Examples would be large group
expeditions, lengthy itineraries involving 5-star properties, 
or complex itineraries not listed as normal vacation products
on the USDT website. (Normally deposits for lodging &amp; diving packages
are about 45% of the total balance due + tariffs, while deposits for live-aboard
diving yachts are about 55% of the total balance due + tariffs.)  <P>

Resort, eco-tour &amp; air ticket 
payments-in-full normally must be received by USDT no later than 75 days before departure.
Full payment of balance due for live-aboard reservations is required
no later than 110 days before departure. We thank you for your considerate cooperation. 
All terms & conditions in this agreement with each USDT client shall be  
interpreted, construed & enforced according to the laws of the 
State of Minnesota, USA.

<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>PAYMENT SCHEDULE WHEN CLIENTS
BOOK a USDT VACATION</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>LESS THAN 75 DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE for RESORTS &amp;  ECO-TOURS, or
</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>LESS THAN 110 DAYS BEFORE DEPARTURE for LIVE-ABOARD VESSELS:
</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>The only exception to this key deadline -- that all final resort & eco-tour payments
must be received before 75 days prior to departure, & liveaboard final payments 110 days prior to departure -- occurs when clients,
in good faith, start the actual booking process already later than these respective 
time frames. This is OK as long as one guideline is followed:  
for those 11th-hour clients, who by happenstance initiate a booking
commitment later than 75 or 110 days (respectively) before departure, their full balance for
all reservations must be paid to USDT no later than 5 days after commitment.  All 11th-hour payments must be made via wire transfer or via FedEx'd cashier's check -- along with all required booking forms.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>
LATE PAYMENT CHARGES:</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

Those 11th-hour clients who miss the afore-mentioned 5-day deadline -- plus any other client who misses a conventional payment deadline -- will be assessed a late-payment fee of no less than $55 per person per day, for each day later than the deadline. This admin fee may be slightly higher for some remote overseas resorts or yachts whose late-payment tariffs are exceptional; or if a client's late payment results in significant lost labor costs. Regardless of the date of initial booking, all clients who miss a deposit deadline or final payment deadline will be charged that same late fee of no less than $55 per person per day late, depending on USDT admin/staff labor lost. 
These deadlines are responsibly enforced, we must respectfully advise you.  And no air tickets or live-aboard vouchers or 
lodging vouchers will be mailed to clients until ALL late fees are paid in full.<BR>
<P>

USDT sets payment deadlines for a good-faith reason, a compelling
reason. As wholesalers, our contracts with service providers (ie. airlines,
hotels, lodges, dive shops, live-aboard vessels &amp; tour companies) require
that we pay on your behalf well in advance of your departure. We need to
honor the service providers’ payment deadlines to secure the lowest net
rates possible, &amp; accordingly the best package savings, for our clients.
We truly want to avoid ever having to assess a penalty fee, because we
value our warm &amp; respectful friendships with clients. However, we are
bound by well-defined contract deadlines &amp; therefore there are no exceptions
to the rule of timely payments for both initial deposit &amp; final balance.
Your kind cooperation is encouraged &amp; also greatly appreciated. Thank
you for your time, your goodwill &amp; your business! </FONT></P>
<FONT SIZE=+0></FONT>

<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>The ONLY ACCEPTED PAYMENT METHODS:
</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>CASHIER’S CHECK, VISA, MASTERCARD
or WIRE TRANSFERS. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>The only payment methods accepted by USDT are cashier's
checks or certified bank checks in U.S. dollars (made out to &quot;U.S. Dive Travel&quot;), Mastercard
&amp; Visa credit cards for published-fare air tickets only, or direct wire transfers into the USDT business
account.  Brokerage wires from companies such as Fidelity, Schwab, Vanguard, etc. are routinely accepted from our preferred clients.  Also bank-to-bank electronic checks or "e-checks" work well.  
<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">No personal checks are accepted, please,
from any clients at any time. USDT will not process
personal checks, nor normal business checks, only bank drafts -- no exceptions. Thank
you again for your gracious understanding.</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">USDT
REQUIRES that ALL CLIENTS WHO ARE NOT RESIDENTS of the UNITED STATES 
PLEASE PAY via DIRECT WIRE TRANSFER to the USDT ACCOUNT -- in U.S. dollars only.</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>
HOW U.S.D.T. WILL PROCESS a MASTERCARD or VISA:</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
For U.S. residents & citizens, in most cases after a client
mails in hardcopy versions of the signed &amp; notarized credit card authorization
form, USDT will accept Mastercard or Visa payments from any client whose
credit card carries sufficient reserves -- but for only published-fare FIT air tickets -- not group fares, nor reservations for resorts, live-aboards or side tours.  Such credit card payments are accepted only after account-status
checks have been completed, & the cardholder's identification is verified.<BR>
<BR>
All credit card payments must be initiated by the client submitting a signed &amp;
notarized authorization form -- easily downloaded off the USDT website
-- on the &quot;How to Book a Trip&quot; page. This page’s Internet
access address is as follows: <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">www.usdivetravel.com/F-Credit_Card_Authoriz.html
</FONT></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
This credit card form must be mailed in its original hardcopy
version to USDT before the client’s card will be debited. Please DO NOT
fax the credit card form; only mailed-in forms will be processed. All credit
card authorization forms must be accompanied by a clear photocopy of the
client’s credit card, showing the card number legibly. USDT
will not accept any credit card payments over the telephone, nor
by fax, nor by E-mail, but only by a signed & notarized Credit Card 
Authorization Form.</FONT></B> 
<P>

The approved authorization form can be
mailed to you by USDT; or you may download it off USDT's website. Then this authorization
form must be signed, notarized &amp; mailed back to USDT to meet the same
payment deadlines as stated in this document above. USDT does not formally process 
credit card numbers over the phone to protect our clients' card security.  
Thank you for your understanding.</FONT></P>

<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>HOW to PAY via DIRECT WIRE TRANSFER:
</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>All wire transfers will be made directly into the USDT
business account &amp; will be assessed a nominal wire-transfer fee, if
USDT is required to relay any client funds overseas via wire transfer.
If no such relay of funds abroad is required, then all timely wire transfers
will be free of wire fees by USDT. For your convenience, the correct ABA
Routing Number + the specific number for USDT’s account can be secured by calling 952-953-4124.  
Please e-mail USDT right after the wire transfer is completed,
to alert our staff  to the payment time & date, the amount, 
the bank of origin & the transaction ID number, so we can properly disburse
your funds on time. For security reasons, USDT
will not convey these account numbers by e-mail; only by telephone for all clients.</FONT></P>



<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>STANDARD SERVICE FEES for ALL
USDT BOOKINGS: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Clients who pay their full balance due for land &amp;
air reservations more than 75 days before departure will be charged USDT's minimum
agency service fee -- only $55 per person. Clients who pay their full balance
less than 75 days out, but more than 45 days before departure, will be charged 
a $65-per-person service fee. Clients who pay their full balance less than
45 days out, but more than 15 days before departure, will be charged a $75-per-person
service fee. However, clients who complete their full payment less than
15 days before departure will incur the maximum $89-per-person agency service
fee. This USDT agency service fee will be levied in addition to the above-stated
late booking fees. These agency service fees are applied fairly & equally to all
clients, all seasons, regardless of payment method, to cover administrative,
staffing &amp; mailing costs &amp; to encourage timely bookings. In contrast,
late-booking fees are different; they cover operating losses, which can
be serious during peak seasons, such as late-booking penalties levied against
USDT by some overseas hotels &amp; vessels, additional overseas phone &amp;
fax costs, &amp; staff overtime, all necessary to complete difficult 11th-hour
bookings accurately.   Further, if a client abruptly changes his/her itinerary after ordering a specific trip plan; or if a client cancels a package after already requiring USDT staffers to expend professional time; or if a client alters complex plans he/she  already approved & ordered, after USDT staffers have already expended professional time fulfilling the client request, then additional service fees will be assessed to cover USDT's lost labor costs.  These tariffs will be administered fairly & equitably via this formula:  USD $100 per hour for labor devoted to solo clients, couples or groups of 3 persons;    USD $140 per hour for client groups larger than 3 persons.  </FONT></P>


<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>
USDT BOOKINGS ARE BINDING CONTRACTS
WITH CLIENTS: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Once a client has signed a diver registration form &amp;
paid the $900 per person resort deposit, or the $1,200 per person live-aboard deposit, 
or the appropriate air ticket deposit, that
signifies his or her full acceptance of all Terms &amp; Conditions of a
good-faith contract with U.S. Dive Travel & partner agencies.  
Paid deposits also mean the client fully &amp; freely gives approval
to all provisions of the Liability Release &amp; Waiver, the Travel Insurance
Advisory, the Credit Card Authorization form, &amp; all other USDT rules
on your Pre-Departure Checklist. Therefore, when you register with USDT
&amp; pay your deposit or full balance due, you are signing a legally binding
contract, not merely a declaration of intent to possibly buy a vacation
package, nor a bid to tentatively hold travel space. The following cancellation
&amp; schedule-change fees are firmly enforced. It is not USDT's desire
to be punitive with deadlines &amp; late-payment fees. Rather USDT works
hard to cut all needless business losses so our trips remain safe, affordable 
&amp; high quality, for all clients all year long. Thank you for helping
us keep our prices as low, &amp; our service quality as high as possible.</FONT></P>




<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>VESSEL & RESORT DISCOUNTS ONLY APPLICABLE BEFORE 1st DEPOSIT is SENT.
</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>In this fast-paced e-Business age, where Tweets, texting, e-mails & web ads can convey new specials & new discounts with instantaneous immediacy, there exists potential for media-generated misunderstanding of USDT pricing policies & special discounts. Therefore, to clarify one important point, here is how new specials & new discounts will apply for all clients, all seasons, all vacation properties & all diving yachts -- no exceptions.  A client may benefit from discount rates only if discounts are first announced by USDT, then claimed by a client <i>before</i> the first invoice is e-mailed to that client, & <i>before</i> the first deposit is sent to USDT by that client. Any client's payment of first deposit, or final payment all-at-once, signifies full acceptance of the booking terms & package pricing presented by USDT in good faith for client review, at that initial point in time.  Therefore, if prices for any vacation package (resort, hotel, live-aboard, etc.) decrease <i>after</i> USDT & a client have agreed to terms & pricing, & <i>after</i> a client already has sent a deposit or final payment by wire, or by mailed-in cashier's check, then any  new discounts will not apply to these older bookings. <b>In short, new discounts will apply only to new bookings made after the specials are published & released publicly.</b>  This policy holds even if, for example, a mailed-in cashier's check is still in transit to USDT's reservations office at the time a new special discount is released.  Prices change frequently, suddenly, randomly at times, all across the world in the adventure travel industry.  Therefore, in all fairness, USDT cannot serve as both backstop banker & price-protection insurance company.  That means when USDT agrees on a net rate with a foreign vendor, then shares a fair & proper retail rate with a client -- who agrees to that invoiced retail rate & then pays an agreed-upon sum -- the initial price agreed upon at time of invoicing shall hold firmly.  The pricing converse will not always hold.  For example: if local taxes rise (a governmental matter beyond the control of any vacation vendor or USDT) after a 1st invoice is sent, but before final payment arrives, then fair & appropriate revisions will be made to a client's invoice to reflect those necessary price changes.</FONT></P>






<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<FONT SIZE=+0>PERSONAL LIABILITY FACTORS: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">On all USDT dive trips &amp;
vacation packages, all diver &amp; non-diver participants alike agree to
assume full &amp; absolute responsibility for any &amp; all risks they
may encounter on land, above water or underwater. Clients must agree to
assume full responsibility for all medical, legal or financial losses that may arise 
from any activities they undertake on any USDT trip, whether or not a client
acts alone, or within a group of tourists.</FONT></B> 
<P>

Furthermore, all
clients must agree &amp; affirm that the contract partnership of USDT /
Wild Island Expeditions &amp; its owners John Hessburg &amp; Susan Hessburg,
plus all USDT contract-associate agencies & all their associates, agents, employees &amp; family
members, shall not be legally or financially liable, nor in any way responsible
for mishaps at any time, anywhere on the dive trip.<BR>
<BR>

All clients further agree &amp; affirm that these two above-named partner
agencies will not be held legally or financially liable for any client's
death, nor for any client's losses of money or property, nor for any illnesses,
injuries or disabilities, nor for damages to personal property, nor for
any delays, expenses or losses that might arise from war, civil insurrection,
strikes, crimes against property or persons, or bad weather conditions;
nor for bankruptcy or default of a resort or dive vessel or airline; 
nor for vessel or vehicle breakdowns, other mechanical failures, transportation
cancellations or defaults (by aircraft, aquatic vessel or land vehicle
companies); nor for government-imposed quarantines or government demands
&amp; regulations; nor for epidemics or diseases; nor for any scheduling
or lodging errors by overseas service providers, whether foreseeable or
not; nor for any acts of omission or defaults by any service providers
(ie. hotels &amp; lodges, live-aboard vessel companies, dive operations,
side-tour companies, guide services, rental car agencies, 
third-party vacation wholesalers); nor for any
&amp; all acts of God such as harsh weather, storm damage to vessels or 
hotels & similar unforeseen 
severe events such as acts of terrorism.</FONT></P>

USDT is a TRAVEL WHOLESALER, a VACATION BROKER<BR>

</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
<font size="+0">
<B>When any client, or client group,
submits a deposit to USDT, that deposit is non-refundable.  Therefore a client deposit is 
understood to be a formal & binding commitment to pay for the vacation package in full, 
& to take the trip that the client requested, & that USDT fulfilled in good faith.  
When any client orders a trip, 
& USDT agents commit work hours 
to organizing & fine-tuning that trip, 
the fact of any client's arbitrary cancellation 
for personal reasons does not erase the fact of USDT's time already committed.
USDT is not a retail travel agency.  We are highly experienced adventure travel brokers, 
international wholesalers of dive travel, 
& tropical tour consultants with a national reputation built upon 3+ decades of hands-on 
experience leading & organizing overseas adventure trips.  Just as you see with physicians, 
attorneys, management consultants & CPAs, when you seek the help of a USDT agent, 
you are paying for staff hours spent rendering 
professional services for you.  And just as it is standard practice with these other professionals, 
consulting time is a saleable resource for which fair & appropriate fees are charged.   For all bookings that require more than basic phone calls, our staff time is compensated at the rate of USD $100 per hour for solo clients, couples or small groups of 3 persons.  That rate rises to USD $140 per hour for special work done on more complex bookings involving groups of more than 3 persons, or custom expeditions, or extended long-range tours with multiple destinations & side tours.  
Furthermore, submission of a deposit by any client indicates that client's full acceptance of USDT's 
cancellation policy, & also acceptance of all USDT Terms & Conditions, as detailed in this 
document you are reading right here.   In many cases, USDT managers will waive some service fees when clients are decisive, well-organized & stick to their decisions after ordering a specific trip to be planned.  Service fees are assessed when client indecision, disorganization, plan reversals or arbitrary last-minute changes cost USDT measurable labor losses & office time to fix.</B>

GIST of the U.S. DIVE TRAVEL CANCELLATION POLICY --<BR>
ONLY APPROVED EMERGENCIES TRIGGER REFUNDS:
</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>If ever USDT deems a client to have a bona fide emergency
-- &amp; the only allowable emergencies are death in the immediate family;
or serious illness, injury or medical condition of the client -- then all
refunds of monies paid to that specific client (not other membes of his/her group) will be administered precisely according
to this policy:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• All deposits &amp; service fees will be non-refundable,
except if there is a death in the immediate family of a client (defined
as death of your spouse, your child or grandchild, your parent, step-parent
or foster parent, your sibling or your grandparent) that forces a client
to cancel a good-faith booking to attend a family memorial service. Airlines
&amp; hotels sometimes require clients in these emergency situations to secure
a brief letter from a funeral director, or a death certificate, confirming the death.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• If the client, or the client's spouse or child contracts
a serious illness, injury or medical condition that forces the client to
cancel. No other situations will trigger refunds. This rule is absolute
&amp; final.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• In the case of illness, injury or medical condition
forcing a client to cancel reservations after payment, the client must
send USDT a formal letter from his or her personal physician (M.D.), on
that physician's official stationary, signed &amp; sealed, describing a
summary of the medical problem &amp; the need to avoid travel during the
precise time of the USDT vacation package the client has already booked.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• No refunds of any kind will be given to any client who
tries to start a USDT-booked trip after its scheduled departure date &amp;
then backs out, or who abandons a trip before it is completed up to the
final date of lodging booked at any hotel, resort, inn, guest house, lodge,
or on any live-aboard vessel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• No refunds of any kind will be given to any client who
fails to show up for a scheduled vacation trip without first submitting
to USDT a letter from a physician (M.D.), or appropriate funeral official,
to explain the emergency in detail before the critical deadlines 
stated below. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• No refunds of any kind will be given to any client who
fails to use lodging, vessel, side tour or diving services included in a paid-for vacation trip, simply because he or she chose not to use said services, which they ordered by free choice from USDT, & which USDT then secured for them in good faith.  Examples of such free-choice decisions not to use paid-for vacation services, all such examples of which are excluded from any refunds, are: "I was too tired;"  or "I did not have the time," or "I was confused & forgot about it"  or  "I changed my mind after arriving."  Simply put, friends -- use it or lose it.  Thank you for your understanding.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• No refunds of any kind will be given to any clients
who complain about quality of service, or ambiance, or quality of local
amenities, at any hotel, lodge, guest house, inn, dive resort, or on any
live-aboard vessel. Service quality, ambiance &amp; local amenities are
factors well beyond USDT's ability to control.</FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=+0>APPROVED EMERGENCY CANCELLATIONS</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<FONT SIZE=+0>&amp; EXPLANATION of EXIT SERVICE FEES: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Client cancellations are extremely costly &amp; time consuming
for USDT &amp; our associate travel professionals to administer correctly.
When USDT's business losses rise, so do prices for all our valued clients.
Therefore, to maintain USDT's impeccable standard of low discount prices
&amp; attentive personal service, USDT long ago enacted a strict policy
to discourage casual, willful &amp; needless cancellations. Any client's
cancellation of air, lodging, land transportation, side-tour or dive-vessel
reservations, or cancellation of any general vacation reservations, is
further subject to whatever penalty fees that the airlines, hotels &amp;
inns, vessel owners, tour operators &amp; travel wholesalers affiliated
with USDT will routinely, by their own internal policy, assess in such situations.
These penalty fees are beyond USDT's ability to control. In all cases when
a client, of his or her own choice, leaves the vacation trip before its
completion, or fails ever to show up for a USDT-booked vacation trip --
for any reason other than the above-specified emergency exceptions -- such
action will be deemed a trip cancellation without good cause &amp; that
client must forfeit the entire deposit &amp; fee balance already paid to
USDT. Here is how USDT will assess exit service fees in all cases of approved
emergency cancellation: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• Clients who cancel a dive trip, or any vacation package,
in writing more than 200 days before departure, if they qualify for an emergency
exception, will be charged only a $400 exit service fee per person, then
will be refunded the allowable balance of their paid fees, minus the deposit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• Clients who cancel a dive trip, or any vacation package,
in writing less than 200 days, but more than 100 days before departure, if
they qualify for an emergency exception, will be charged a $500 exit service
fee per person then will be refunded the allowable balance of their paid
fees, minus the deposit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• Clients who cancel a dive trip, or any vacation package,
in writing less than 100 days, but more than 70 days before departure, if they qualify for an emergency
exception, will be charged a $700 exit service fee per person before the
remainder of their allowable fee balance is refunded, minus the deposit.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• Clients who cancel a dive trip, or any vacation package,
in writing less than 70 days before departure, if they qualify for an emergency
exception, will be charged a $900 exit service fee per person before the
remainder of their allowable fee balance is refunded, minus the deposit.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=+0>•<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> All client cancellation letters
must arrive at USDT no later than 33 days before scheduled departure time,
or no refunds of any kind will be given. USDT's approved emergency
exceptions for cancellation refunds -- death in immediate family &amp;
personal medical emergency -- do not apply once a trip has already started.  For these types of dire unforeseen events, travel cancellation insurance is a must, friends.
</FONT></B>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• All clients will be refunded their fee balance -- minus deposits & tariffs -- if the
qualifying emergency is USDT itself (unilaterally) deciding to cancel a dive trip for any good
&amp; compelling cause, such as natural or political danger overseas.
This provision does NOT apply if the resort or vessel make this closure decision first, 
or if a compelling act of God such as Hurricane Mitch in October '98, suddenly destroys 
or renders inoperable a live-aboard or a vacation property.  
Furthermore, service fees collected at any time during the booking process
are fully non-refundable, regardless of a client's emergency cancellation

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>PENALTY FEES for NON-EMERGENCY
CANCELLATION: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>• If a client wishes to cancel any vacation booking, yet
qualifies for none of the above-listed emergency exceptions, &amp; already
has paid all fees in full, &amp; cancels in writing earlier than 100 days
before departure, that client will forfeit all deposits paid, but will
be refunded the full remaining balance, minus service fees, in form of a credit voucher applied towards the cost of  a future trip -- redeemable within one calendar year of the cancellation date.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• If a client who qualifies for no emergency exception
seeks to cancel any reservation more than 100 days before departure, &amp;
that client already has paid only the land deposit, or the vessel deposit, plus appropriate
air ticket deposit, then that client forfeits all of his or her deposits
&amp; service fees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• If a client cancels any vacation reservation less than
100 days but more than 70 days before departure, &amp; already has paid
the full fee balance, but qualifies for none of the above-mentioned emergency
exceptions, that client will forfeit all deposits &amp; will incur an additional
$500 charge per person for administrative costs, then will be refunded
the remaining sum already paid, minus all service fees, in form of a credit voucher applied towards the cost of a future trip, redeemable within one calendar year of the cancellation date. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• If a client who already has paid in full cancels any
booking less than 70 days before departure, &amp; has no qualifying emergency,
that client not only forfeits all deposits, but will be charged a $900
fee per person before being refunded the remaining sum already paid, minus all service fees, in form of a credit voucher applied towards the cost of a future trip, redeemable within one calendar year of the cancellation date. 

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>•<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> Non-approved cancellations, with
no emergency factors whatsoever, which occur less than 33 days out, will
incur forfeit of all monies paid. No exceptions.  Said client will lose all payments for all services.</FONT></B>

<P><BR></P>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>REFUNDS AFTER APPROVED EMERGENCY
CANCELLATIONS: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>In most cases, cash refunds will never be made to clients who cancel.  
Instead, approved emergency refunds to clients for lodging, dive
trips, live-aboard vessels, side tours, all forms of land transportation
&amp; any other pre-paid land or water services will be administered in
this following manner. First, approved refunds to clients will be minus all
USDT service fees already paid, & minus the deposits already paid. In nearly all cases, these refunds will
be granted by overseas service providers (ie. airlines, hotels, vessels, travel wholesalers
&amp; tour operators) only in the form of a credit voucher -- never by
cash or credit card charge reversals. This credit voucher allows the cancelling
client to repeat his or her originally planned vacation -- the identical
package -- at a later more convenient date. This make-up vacation date
must start no later than one calendar year after the client's cancellation date.  Since most refunds under this provision will be credit vouchers for less than the total sum 
originally paid by the cancelling client, that means when the client reinstates new reservations, they will be assessed the remaining balance due, to ensure full payment to overseas service providers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>• Airline ticket refunds will be subject to the standard
cancellation fees that airlines apply according to their official fare
rules for that specific class of service the client has booked. These airline
cancellation penalties may be substantial, sometimes in excess of 50 percent
of the ticket price, sometimes even 100 percent, depending on the carrier's fare rules for that specific cancelled ticket. The airlines have full
authority over cancellation refunds. USDT is allowed only to administer
their final ruling. Once the airline deducts their own penalty fees for
ticket cancellation, then USDT reserves the right to deduct additional
service fees, as needed, to cover all administrative costs, &amp; airline-imposed
contract debits that accrue from the client's cancellation, before any
final refund is delivered to the client.</FONT></P>


<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>NO EXTRAORDINARY REFUNDS ARE
ALLOWED: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>If USDT books airline tickets or lodging or side tours
in good faith for any client, after the client orders a specific set of
vacation services &amp; travel dates, &amp; then the client pays either
deposit or full balance, &amp; then the client later books a similar trip
with another travel agency, or directly with vacation service providers,
then demands a refund for whatever reason, all monies paid to USDT will
be retained &amp; the client forever forfeits all rights to claim any refunds.<BR>
<BR>

Once a dive trip has been booked &amp;
the deposit &amp;/or full balance is paid for, USDT will not allow any
client to make unilaterally planned changes to the schedule (apart from
USDT), or to accommodations or itinerary of any vacation trip, unless the
client agrees to pay all necessary penalty fees & 
service fees that are required by this agreement. 
These penalty fees
will be assessed to cover any &amp; all USDT costs &amp; losses, as well
as all costs &amp; losses incurred by vacation service providers, including
but not limited to hotels, lodges, resorts, dive operations, tour companies,
rental car agencies &amp; airlines. <BR>
<BR>
USDT &amp; all of their agents, contract
associates &amp; representatives reserve the right to make any last-minute
modifications necessary in a client's vacation schedule, itinerary, lodging
or side tours -- either before or after the departure date -- to adjust
to sudden &amp; unexpectedly serious changes in overseas conditions that
directly affect the safety or feasibility of the client's trip. Such last-minute
modifications will be made only with the utmost care for the client's welfare;
&amp; may involve cancellation of the client's entire trip, with appropriate
refunds, due to unforeseen emergencies or natural disasters.</FONT></P>


<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>NO POST-DEPARTURE CHANGES to
ITINERARIES ALLOWED: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Once any USDT client has departed
on his or her vacation trip, then that client may not make any unilateral
changes to the lodging, meal plan, dive vessel schedule, side tours, land
transport, international air transport, nor foreign commuter air transport
components of the vacation package, unless the client assumes complete
financial &amp; legal responsibility for any &amp; all costs stemming from
such travel changes. </FONT></B>
<P>

Therefore, if any client unilaterally after
departure, when abroad or on a domestic U.S. portion of a vacation itinerary,
decides to cancel any portion of the vacation package already booked through
USDT &amp; paid for, then that client must agree to forfeit all monies
already paid to USDT for said cancelled services. Said client shall also forever waive any right to
level claims for any manner of refund -- for any unused services paid for
before departure. The reasoning behind this rule is not punitive, but it is only
an effort to protect the USDT partnership from clients who book a package
without giving full thought to their vacation needs before departure. Once
USDT has committed staff time, phone &amp; fax resources &amp; mailings
to secure any portion of a client’s reservation, if the client chooses
not to use these services, he or she will lose them. 
USDT spends hours completing the preparations 
for even a conventional one-week vacation for a couple.  
When a client commits to a booking, USDT in 
turn commits to many hours of planning work.  
Those hours cannot go uncompensated for reasons of personal whim, or an arbitrary change of mind. 
Thank you for your understanding.</FONT></P>

USDT'S RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY BOOKING:
</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>USDT reserves the absolute right to refuse to book any
person as a vacation client -- for any good &amp; just cause -- such as USDT
deeming that the applicant's health, conditioning, attitude, temperament,
diving qualifications, preparedness (or any other factors) make him or
her unfit for an overseas adventure experience -- especially if that unfit
applicant might be a hazard to the safety, comfort, enjoyment or peace
of mind of any other dive-trip participants. USDT expresses full respect
for persons of all races, religions, minority groups &amp; nationalities.
Therefore any USDT decision to reject a trip applicant never will be based
upon considerations of race, religion, nationality or minority status,
but will be based solely upon weighing possible detriments of the unfit
applicant to the general well-being &amp; safety of himself or other clients.</FONT></P>

contractually bound by all Terms &amp; Conditions of this agreement, &amp;

<FONT SIZE=+0>LUGGAGE LIMITATIONS: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>All airlines have their own particular regulations for
luggage limitations &amp; excess baggage fees for international flights.
Please note: it is the client's sole &amp; complete responsibility to call
the airline well in advance of his or her dive trip to determine what luggage
rules apply. USDT therefore will not be held responsible in any way for
excess baggage fees assessed to clients by any airline booked via USDT.</FONT></P>

<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+0>To ensure maximum safety, comfort, enjoyment &amp; healthy

USDT dive trips, completion of all appropriate items on the checklist is
recommended for all clients, without exception. Items listed as optional are
up to the client's own discretion. </FONT></P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>WHETHER a VISA is NEEDED for
YOUR DESTINATION !) </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>National government requirements for tourist entry vary
from one country to another. All USDT clients are solely responsible for
securing their own valid passport &amp; proper entry visa, if visas are
required in the country of your chosen destination. Feel free to call USDT
any time for advice on passports &amp; visas. Friendly hint: all U.S. citizens
traveling to Australia need a visa. Please check with your airline well
in advance of departure to determine whether securing a visa is required
before you leave the U.S., or whether your vacation host country will automatically
issue a visa upon arrival. Understand that USDT will grant no refunds whatsoever
to clients who arrive overseas &amp; are denied entry to any country because
they failed to secure a proper passport or visa beforehand. Please double-check
the validity of your passport before you board the plane! It is a very
wise idea to ensure that at least six months buffer time is left on your
passport, in case you experience any unforeseen medical or legal emergency
that might force you to overstay your normal tourist visa.  Getting stuck in a Third World 
country with an expired passport can be a nightmare.  Be prudent.</FONT></P>

in the fliers or brochures for all of our destinations. For the prices
stated therein, only the specified goods &amp; services listed in these

are cautioned against assuming that any unspecified services will be provided
on their dive trip, or on their non-diving vacation package. Among normal
overseas (or stateside) travel expenses not included in your vacation package
are the following (there may be others as well): passport fees; postal
charges; customs fees or airport departure taxes; transport in the U.S.
to the airport; local on-island taxis; personal expenses such as laundry,
gifts, handicrafts, alcoholic beverages &amp; entertainment; tips of any

legally or financially liable for any acts, errors, omissions
or mishaps that may occur during any time a USDT client passenger is not
on board their planes or transport vehicles. The airline ticket each client

If a client wishes to use frequent flier miles or discount coupons for

of any vacation that is designed as a package. USDT prices do not include

AMENDMENTS PERMITTED: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Completion of the registration, liability release &amp;
waiver packet that accompanies your vacation receipt is mandatory for all
clients, for all USDT dive trips or other adventure trips -- both &quot;do-it-yourself&quot;
&amp; guided vacations. The U. S. Dive Travel partnership can allow no
exceptions to this important rule. Thank you for your goodwill &amp; your
understanding. Reasons for this policy are explained below.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">No
airline tickets, nor vouchers for lodging, vessels, diving or any side
tours will be delivered to any USDT client until the full three-part waiver
packet is filled out, signed, notarized &amp; air-mailed or sent by courier back to USDT. 
No alterations, additions, cross-outs, amendments or inserts of
any kind will be permitted on any portion of this liability release &amp;
waiver packet. No person may sign another client’s liability release, nor
travel insurance advisory, nor registration form -- just for convenience --
except parents signing for their minor children.
</FONT></B>

<P>

When one adult signs another's liability forms, this 
constitutes a fraudulent &amp; invalid signature &amp;
therefore places the client at risk of having his or her trip cancelled
for due cause. This policy is absolute &amp; final. Failure to sign these
waivers, &amp; any alterations of these waivers, &amp; any forgery of signatures,
may be deemed a cancellation of the vacation trip &amp; appropriate cancellation
penalty fees will be levied. Thank you for your understanding & cooperation. </FONT></P>


<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>WHY ARE LIABILITY WAIVERS NECESSARY
? </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>The USDT partnership has instituted this liability waiver
policy to help reduce liability exposure to a bare minimum, &amp; thereby
keep insurance costs as low as possible. This policy therefore ensures
that you, our esteemed client, get the lowest prices possible for all facets
of your vacation package, as well as the highest level of personalized
client service available in the adventure-travel industry. USDT has been
forced by an environment of attorneys &amp; insurance officials, who regulate
vast sectors of our industry in this litigation-saturated era, to adopt
this waiver &amp; release policy for the mutual protection of the USDT
partnership as well as the protection of our good clients. Therefore, the
three U.S. Dive Travel forms which much be completed then signed by all
clients are: the Registration Form, the Travel Insurance Advisory, &amp;
the Liability Waiver &amp; Release. Please make sure that your signature
on the liability form is verified by a notary public. Thank you again for
your goodwill. Your signing these forms helps us keep your package prices
as low as possible. All our diving clients benefit, when each person signs
these releases.</FONT></P>


<BR>
<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>ALERT to ALL PARENTS TRAVELING
WITH MINOR CHILDREN: </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Please be forewarned that airline officials &amp; U.S.
government authorities at all major gateway airports in the United States
-- where passengers board for flights to Hawaii or foreign countries –
will prevent a solo parent or guardian from boarding their plane with an
underaged child, unless that adult has a signed &amp; notarized letter
of permission, clearly written, from both of the child’s biological parents.
That is, if both birth parents of any child under the age of 18 are not
on the plane with that child, then the traveling adult responsible for
that child MUST have that signed &amp; notarized letter of permission,
allowing the minor to travel, from the birth parent who is not present
-- before the airline &amp; immigration officials will allow you to board
your flight overseas. This rule is strictly enforced at most airports &amp;
should not be taken lightly. The reasoning behind the law, of course, is
to prevent parents from kidnapping or hiding children from the other parent
in situations of disputed divorces or separations, where the child may
become a political pawn.</FONT></P>
