<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">GREAT NEWS for LIZARD LOVERS!!  Delaware North Companies LIZARD ISLAND Resort has been voted the number one hotel in Australia, South Pacific and New Zealand for service by readers of Travel &  Leisure magazine in the USA.  </font>The annual World�s Best Service Awards were published in a relatively recent issue, after a detailed survey of 900,000 subscribers. Delaware North Companies Lizard Island received a rating of 92.11, eclipsing all others in the Australia, New Zealand &  greater SoPac region.</I></B>

</B></FONT>Like Rolls Royce, Rolex &amp; Dom Perignon, some products carry such a time-honored glow of distinction &amp; luxury that advertising is superfluous. The name itself is its own best advertisement. Vacations at <B>LIZARD ISLAND</B>, the crown jewel of Australia's Great Barrier Reef, are easily placed in this exclusive league.</P>
<P>A 5-diamond operation, <B>LIZARD ISLAND</B> is the most impeccably appointed resort in all of Australia's reef perimeter, &amp; one of the world's finest luxury atoll resorts, according to travel writers &amp; tour professionals. Discovered first by Captain James Cook, &amp; named after the shy monitor lizards that inhabit its crannies, the island has become a fantasy playground for a select cadre of scuba divers &amp; snorkeling enthusiasts. These are men &amp; women for whom great is not nearly good enough when it comes to vacation comfort. <B>LIZARD ISLAND</B>  transcends great. This remote &amp; completely unspoiled atoll is perfect for clients who insist upon only the finest in luxury accommodations, gourmet cuisine, brilliant reef diversity &amp; kid glove service.</P>
<P>The island is circumscribed with 24 private beaches &amp; coves, most of which are blanketed in pristine, white sugar sand. If you need to escape, you'll find your own private nook in a wink. The staff-to-guest ratio is nearly two staffers to every three guests. The verb "pamper" is an understatement when applied to the TLC touch that <B>LIZARD ISLAND</B> workers apply to their daily service. </P>

<P>Of its 2,500 land acres, 20 acres have been reserved for the following elegant amenities: beautifully decorated rooms all featuring air conditioning, bath robes, hairdryer, direct dial ISD/ STD telephone, internet access, ceiling fans, tea &amp; coffee making facilities, mini bar, CD player, iron &amp; ironing board, laundry service, beach towels &amp; umbrellas, evening turndown service.

Therefore, Lizard Island is great for singles, or also for couples seeking a romantic escape &amp; special groups of adult friends.  And remember the exciting Australia diving packages & also Australia snorkeling options.</P>
<P>Only the most perfectly select seafoods, meats, succulent fruits &amp; vegetables are used in the dining room, which features a world-class <I>cordon bleu</I> international menu, where every dinner is a taste adventure, &amp; the wine list will delight even a hawk-eyed oenophile. The chefs here do not scrimp when it comes to meals; &amp; Lizard's cuisine has received rave reviews across the Pacific region.  Who says Australia scuba vacations are only about huffing happy bubbles underwater?  There's always the Dom Perignon topside, folks.</P>

<P>Ensconced on a private atoll with a lagoon so magical in hue -- a meld of aquamarine, turquoise, emerald green &amp; electric royal blue -- Lizard Island is 27 kilometers across the Coral Sea from the nearest car, TV, newspaper or traffic-riddled city. The island has been designated an Australian National Park -- it's truly that special. Take a peek at the guest register &amp; you'll see signatures of royalty, politicians &amp; actors of renown.</P>
<P>After scuba diving or snorkeling around a lagoon that offers a myriad perfect bommies with fish &amp; coral in wild abundance -- try the Giant Clam Gardens where the denizens are nearly 150 years old! -- you may want to unwind even further with archery, hikes to a scenic outlook 1,100 feet above the ocean, birdwatching, catamaran sailing, wind surfing, water skiing, glass-bottom paddle-boats, chef-catered picnics or tennis.</P>
<P>The reefs here are only a few mellow yards from your beach, &amp; so easily accessible it will amaze you. It is no effort to just step into the ocean &amp; in seconds you're in the heart of the Outer Great Barrier Reef. It's all right there in your mask, so close you'll be hypnotized by the gentle beauty &amp; rich colors. The diversity of fish &amp; coral life is dazzling, even on those few gray-weather days. You'll be tempted to dive again &amp; again every day.  
Australia diving vacations get under your skin, in a wonderful way.  Few dive resorts in the world can match Lizard Island.</P>
<P>For scuba enthusiasts, the world-famous Cod Hole site where giant potato cods in the 200-300-lb range are thriving, is only a short boat trip from Lizard Island. Nearly every week of the year, scuba diving yachts from Cairns (150 miles to the South) zoom up to Lizard Island to experience the adventure of Cod Hole.  It's right in your own back yard! 
How do we put this, not too cheekily?  Cod Hole is to Australia's scuba diving scene as the Statue of Liberty is to New York City.</P>

Every "T" is crossed on Lizard Island, where not<BR>
one iota of client comfort has been overlooked.<BR>
This is the standard by which all Great Barrier Reef<BR>
resorts are measured. Simply brilliant amenities!<BR>

</CENTER></B></FONT> 



<P>Now there's another way to play in the perfect waters near Cod Hole.  Besides being a scuba diving Mecca, & a haven for Australia snorkeling enthusiasts, Lizard Island draws game fishermen like an azure magnet. The clear, clean waters surrounding Lizard Island are regarded as one of the world's best fishing grounds for big game species, especially huge prizes such as the elusive black marlin. Prime time for the big ones is August through December. Sport fishermen from all over the world come to Lizard Island to ply their skill &amp; strength against these giants, some of which have weighed in at more than 1,000 lbs!</P>
<P>All private suites include A/C &amp; ceiling fan, refrigerator, private bathrooms &amp; twin vanities, hair dryer &amp; bathrobes, phone, shower, bath, balcony, king or queen beds, mini-bar, desk, intercom &amp; ironing board. The scuba shop on island is top grade with plenty of tanks &amp; a vessel ready to go whenever you are. There's a Royal Flying Doctor clinic right on the premises, which maintains ready radio contact with mainland medical air-evacuation teams in the unlikely event of an emergency.</P>
<P>Except for scuba diving, all watersports &amp; tennis are included in your land package, as are catered picnics on private beaches, all at no extra charge. Australia snorkeling packages always include the best part free -- the snorkeling of course! Lizard Island even has its own small bank &amp; library. Major credit cards are accepted as well.  This might be the remote Great Barrier Reef, but all refinements are found.</P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>HISTORICAL BACKGROUND of LIZARD ISLAND:<BR>
</B></FONT>During his celebrated exploratory voyage of 1770, the legendary Captain James Cook climbed the high hill on Lizard Island to look out over the Great Barrier Reef nearby, &amp; from there he bagan to chart a course out to sea through the labyrinth of tricky reefs awaiting his vessels. Today Lizard Island offers an escape of a different kind. A unique holiday on the Great Barrier Reef's northern most island resort.</P>
<P>If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, then Lizard Island is your cup of tea. This is by any standard of international measurement, one of Australia's best 5-star luxury resorts. Being right on the Great Barrier Reef is rare enough, but Lizard Island offers the full spectrum - both the inner &amp; outer Reef experiences. </P>
<P>Here you can snorkel off a secluded beach to discover a garden of giant clams, many a metre long &amp; some reputed to be over 120 years old. &amp; there are 23 more soft, powdery white beaches just waiting to be explored. Lizard Island is renowned for its diving. At the world famous 'Cod Hole', you'll come face to face with a massive yet curious potato cod swimming right up to inspect you with child-like curiosity. When you're scuba diving, you're their buddy.</P>
<P>Whilst the fish at Cod Hole may not respect your privacy, we certainly will. In fact, we'll pack a picnic lunch for two &amp; guide you to a 'private beach' to enjoy this magic location undisturbed. There are many fun &amp; refreshing walks, &amp; on at least one you can expect to glimpse a monitor, the lizard after which the island was named. Healthy appetites -- honed by the Australia snorkeling or Australia scuba diving efforts -- are then rewarded with superb dining - fresh local produce prepared with European &amp; Asian influence. All island meals &amp; most activities are included in the tariff &amp; although remote, ferry access from Gladstone (departing at about 11 am each day) is easy. </P>

Prices here above are per person, &amp; include all meals on island + sales tax. These prices do not include the USDT tariff, nor the currency exchange buffer fee.

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT NOTE about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P>
</B></FONT><P>All graphics on this webpage are provided courtesy of Delaware North Companies.  Some of the text blocks are courtesy of Lizard Island Resort, as well.  All Australia snorkeling & Australia diving package prices listed here for Lizard Island Resort are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Land prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge for one decade now. We normally secure excellent discount air tickets. Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals. </P>
<P>Unless specifically noted, these above Australia scuba diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of your vacation, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At most dive resorts &amp; on most live-aboard vessels, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions may be noted. International &amp; commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the lodging + diving components. The baseline tariffs for all Lizard Island Resort clients, whether on the Australia snorkeling or Australia diving packages, always start at $35 per person for the land portion + $25 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving. Solo clients will always pay a single supplement to secure a private room -- normally 35% to 50% more -- &amp; possibly a full doubling of the standard double-occupancy rate at some resorts, &amp; on most live-aboards.</P>
<P>The preferred payment mode for all lodging, Australia snorkeling packages, Australia scuba diving tours &amp; other side tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their Great Barrier Reef dive vacations only via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any reservation, please. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest &amp; our prices the lowest in this industry, &amp; thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard. For ultra-discount wholesale air tickets, however, USDT accepts only cashier's checks, please.</P>
<P>Remember, all clients leaving Lizard Island Resort will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $25 - $40 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; &amp; away you go. Best of luck with your travel plans for Lizard Island Resort. We hope your vacation is a safe &amp; satisfying adventure. Blessings &amp; best wishes with your dive vacations from all the friends of Delaware North Companies.</P>
<P>Best fishes too!</P>
