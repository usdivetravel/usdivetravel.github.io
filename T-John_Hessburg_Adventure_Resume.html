</P>



<UL>

<LI>&quot;So, just who are these folks at USDT / Live-Aboards.com? To whom are we entrusting our tropical

travel plans, and our  payments?&quot;<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>&quot;What kind of international travel experience does USDT have, to

help organize my trip in life-positive ways I may not have considered myself?&quot;<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>&quot;Have they first-hand experienced special tropical island locales I haven't seen yet? Might they

offer some seasoned insights into helping me maximize my economy, safety, comfort &amp; enjoyment?&quot;<BR>

</LI>

</UL>


<P>Whether you book a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; trip, one of our 

guided dive-yacht vacations with Live-Aboards.com,  a customized exploratory tour with  Wild Island Expeditions, or a regular week's dive trip at a fun resort, this information will help you make your decision

<P>Following is the adventure travel profile of the man who carries the

prime responsibility for overseeing your customer service, your satisfaction

&amp; your personal security overseas -- John Hessburg --  founder of <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S.

DIVE TRAVEL & Live-Aboards.com.</FONT></B>. This detailed r�sum� covers many highlights -- but not all -- of John's wilderness adventures 

in the mountains, on &amp; under the ocean, in trackless deserts &amp; deep jungles in far-flung regions around

the world since 1970.   Several of the most remote explorations have been kept off this list -- a matter of ethical choice -- to  protect sensitive wilderness sectors that are vulnerable to tourism impact.   But many of the most memorable adventures still made the list. <//P>

<P>Bottom Line: at USDT the buck stops here.  So we invite you take a few minutes, &amp; meet the guy who signs the contracts &amp; musters the team around here.  John is so hyper-focused on planning details + safety for our clients that (when he's out of the room) we like to call him (yes he's a full-tilt Type-A) -- "Mr. Relaxo."<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>NEW CALEDONIA: Grande Terre &amp; Loyalty Islands, Southwest Pacific --</FONT></FONT></B><BR></P>
<UL>

<LI><FONT SIZE=-1>Hiked beaucoup beaches, ran photo shoots in jungle villages, toured the vast island of <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Grand Terre</B></font>, main isle of this seldom-visited French colony about 1,200 miles NW of New Zealand.  We trekked inland "sand rivers" -- ancient dried-up tidal inlets -- & explored the fringing reefs of <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Ile des Pins</B></font>.  Renowned for towering <I> Araucaria </I>  trees up to 80 feet tall, this Isle of Pines is home to laid-back natives & legions of the deadliest striped sea snakes in the world.  They are "Tricot Rayes" ( <I>laticauda colubrina</I> ) & are remarkably shy though lethal critters. By night, we crossed the Big Blue more than 120 nautical miles from Ile des Pins northward to Mare island, on the skirts of a vicious typhoon south of us, which stirred huge swells, topped by heavy right-angle chop.  Whoa Nelly.  Most brutal crossing ever.  After that, 2 weeks in the Loyalty Islands brought some of the most exhilarating reef dives & jungle jaunts of a lifetime.  These New Caledonia island explorations were a picture-perfect trip -- blessed with calm clear weather, mild humidity, hospitable villagers everywhere we turned, endless life-rich reefs, & sunsets gleefully splatter-dashed across the sky in eye-candy tones of molten copper with stained glass blues that segued first to police-strobe blues, then nearly-audible indigos -- all of it splashed by some wanton Jackson Pollock in the stratosphere.  Astonishing beauty everywhere: in the island foliage, flowers, village children playing, marine life darting about expanses of coral.  The free diving was wonderful, a fun kaleidoscope of species, especially off Lifou island.  All explorations in NewCal were shared with "herzliche Freunden," our new friends Fred Looijschelder (Netherlands) & Christiana Kaluscha (Germany), who were world-class sailors & navigators.  -- June & July 2001.<P> 

<li>Fred & Christiana's beautiful 110-foot teak-decked schooner originally was built in Europe & owned by a royal family, then sailed halfway around the world to their SoPac homeports in Vanuatu & New Caledonia.  Our 6-person team explored virgin reefs & seamounts -- likely never visited by North American or European divers before us -- for about 200 nautical miles surrounding the Loyalty Islands of <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Mare, Lifou & Ouvea</B></font>.  Our NewCal Expedition circumnavigated most diveable shores of these magnificent islands, mapping & logging many new scuba diving & snorkeling sites, trading for whole foods with native villagers, witnessing rare religious dancing rites at night, relishing some of the most untrammeled reefs in the South Pacific.   Climbed about  200 feet up the face of a bizarre "Jackie-O Pillbox Hat" formation -- a cylindrical tower of millennia-old minerals thrust skyward by plate shifting -- near the village of La Roche on Mare island.   Blanketing the summit of this coral & limestone oatmeal box are centuries of living & dead vines, creeping kudzu-like foliage & storm-woven sticks, forming a treacherous mat over crevasses up to 100 feet deep.  If you stepped imprudently, these hidden holes could suck you into oblivion in one eyeblink, while your buddy was looking the other way.  You'd never surface 'til the Second Coming.  Had to mince gingerly across the summit, while several veggie/stick mats snapped under our weight as we leapt for life onto the next jagged knob.  <P>

<li>Later, was handed ship's helm duty for 2 days, 25 nautical miles per day, as we sailed happily, engines off, in ideal sun & lazy winds around most of Lifou Island, next gem west of Mare in this wild archipelago.  (Ouvea is further west). Found one reef plateau a mile offshore of Lifou, in less than 45'  of calm seas, teeming with vivid species -- jewel-like shells with extra-terrestrial shapes, dazzling schools of li'l fish flitting about, corals of every hue.  Some species we had never seen before in the South Pacific.  Perhaps a taxonomist's dreamscape?  ( Forgive us sunseekers; we'll never publish the GPS #s. )  This one's not for sale.  Glory be -- what a magical time... days of wit & whimsy, artful conversations in a rapid-fire melange of French, Spanish, German & "Franglais," frequent piquant puns, waves of laughter, flagons of fine French wine with fresh fish suppers nearly every day.  (Our enterprising cook had a couple baited lines dangling over the gunwales every afternoon; & she scored no less than one meaty lunker a day!) Best pun of the trip was a play on the French word for bread -- " <I>pain</I> " -- pronounced "pan."  Irked by the scarcity of fresh bread in all villages of Ile des Pins (pronounced "Eel da Pan"), we dubbed that island " <I>Ile de Peu Pain.</I> "  Ah... this Isle of Little Bread aside, there were so many perfect days.<P> 

<li>Then "that pesky reality" intruded ....  Inexplicably, our master mariner friends lost their beloved schooner about 3 months after our successful expedition concluded, when they sailed from Vanuatu to SE Australia.  Their written report to USDT stated that a savage storm 100 miles off the coast of Sydney snapped both masts & toppled them, crushing the vessel's hull.  Aussie coast guard mounted a swift rescue; all hands saved.  Our hearts go out to Fred & Chris.  In one sudden moment, smacked by Neptune's random wrath, they lost their home, their livelihood, their South Pacific dream.  But they are still sailing the SoPac, crewing yachts again we've been told, pressing on with inexpressable courage.  Fred & Christiana are strong, resourceful & gifted with keen creativity.  They are beautiful human beings & will never be forgotten.  " <I>Asi es la vida, che'.  Nunca se te regala nada gratis.</I> "</FONT></b><P>

Foremost sites we dived were <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Soso Passage (6 nm west of Matava),  Vesi Passage & "Dreamland" shallows (1 nm east of Matava) + Koro Levu Passage (1.5 nm east of Matava). </FONT></B>Visibility up to 100'. Powerful surge & cross-shore currents in all the passes, except for an hour at slack tides.  We saw abundant small healthy reef sharks, mainly whitetips, schools of feeding pelagics along the outside walls (yellowfin, 'cuda & jacks prevail) & in Dreamland the soft corals & smaller species were brilliant.  Some oceanographers are gathering data they believe will prove much of the coral-polyp "seeding" that in spawning times repopulates Fijian waters for hundreds of square miles to the north, may originate in the healthy prolific soft corals of Kadavu's Astrolabe Reef.  This is one of the most brilliant & colorfully healthy barrier reefs we've ever experienced anywhere in the Pacific.  April 2009. </FONT><BR>

</FONT></B>approx 40 miles south of Viti Levu Island, at a classic site called <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"> Turtle Mountain, </FONT></B> free-diving with expert local OWSI Orisi Vulibulu of Vatulele Island Resort, we spent approx 3 hours tooling about the outer rims of walls just 300-400 meters offshore, enthralled by a large school of whitetip reef sharks in a feeding frenzy.Visibility up to 120'.  Their numbers swelled as time went on, until the group was twitching, circling & tussling violently, in search of what appeared to be a wounded sea turtle that had found refuge under a tight rock shelf too narrow for the sharks to probe or enter.  We wondered how long that poor turtle could hold out, holding his breath, & we rooted for him though he was hopelessly outgunned.

</FONT></B> Accompanied by the lively & talented Matangi Resort's Ms. Ally Heffernan, a PADI / OWSI, we dived these Fijian classics:<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"> Yellow Wall,  Noel's Wall  &  Veranda II. </FONT></B>Visibility up to 120'. The 1,000' precipitous dropoff of Yellow Wall 7 km NNE of Matagi Island offers abundant corals & small reef fish near the lip down to 70'.  Approx 10 km NNE of Matangi, Noel's Wall, named after Matangi Resort's gracious patriarch Noel Douglas (whose family has owned Matagi Island for nearly half a century) regaled us with whitetip reef sharks, silver barracuda, breath-takingly vivid purple acropore corals, plate corals the size of Chevy pickups, bright orange & violet anthias & huge healthy brain corals.  The El Ninos of the last 15 years have done precious little harm to this Soft Coral Bastion of the SoPac.  The reefs & walls are still resplendent!  At slack tide the 3 Verandas near Matangi Island's northern shoreline offer superb shallow snorkeling & free diving, with scores of super-healthy hard & soft coral species & perhaps 100+ species of small critters.   One of the best soft-coral & small critter days of the last 20 years.  Matangi-area corals are still in excellent shape, & thank God have escaped the devastation that global warming is inflicting on many of the SoPac's barrier reefs & atoll rims. May 2009. </FONT><BR>

</FONT></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>Dreamed & schemed over plans for 25 years, but forced to postpone repeatedly by epic events from marriage to childbirth to foreign expeditions.  Finally pounded 'er out one perfect summer 3-day weekend.  Along with top wilderness adventure pal of 30+ years, Bob "Bonz" Shaw, secured a modest 16-foot skiff & motored (rather sputtered) more than 135-mile loop from Hastings MN southward, dodging huge barge flotillas that continually half-swamped the boat, down the Mighty Muddy Ol' Miss through Red Wing's Lock-&-Dam #2, then down through vast wave-battered Lake Pepin, then along towering sand dunes & ancient limestone bluffs, past Chippewa River, through Lock-&-Dam #3 to Lacrosse WI -- & back upriver to Hastings of course.  River charts are essential, & their cautionary notes will punish the inattentive.  Smashed a prop to bits on a hidden wing dam just south of Hastings, repaired it in a couple hours then set off with renewed enthusiam.  Discovered some primo wild backwater campsites -- all off the main Mississippi River channel -- incredible to behold, within 50 miles of the urban sprawl of Mpls-St. Paul.  Best near-urban camping we ever experienced in decades.   Several sites impossible to reach by road, only by long river  traverses, wending through risky sand bar labyrinth.   Get stuck on the wrong sand bar just before sunset, you may get plowed under by the next 200-foot coal barge.  But Lady Luck & some barefoot heave-ho's, yanking us off sand bars, blessed the trip.  Wonderful wildlife everywhere, from tail-slappin' beavers, to face-bruisin' flying fish, to soaring hawks & eagles.  Even wildcat & badger spoor near the tent sites, which were on beaches neat with clean tawny sand.  Stars by the millions each night, more laughs than that.  Packed out every scrap, as usual.  Never a molecule of litter.  Policed beaches we passed but never camped on.  Just because.  Packed out mounds of plastic & glass flotsam from ratbag river revelers long gone.  That's a Bonz Brothers law, amigos del agua.   1st trip August 2004.  Variations on this theme: with both wives in August 2005.  With all 3 "Gonzo Bonzo" sons in August 2007, & again in September 2008.

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1>Bucked 6,500 lbs of tough hardwood logs on family property with Stihl 440 / 20" / 5 hp chainsaw, then hand split 7.5 face cords in 3 months, working solo with 20 lb iron hammer & wedges + 5 lb splitting axe, 2-3 hours a day, 5 days a week after office hours.  Wood was sinewy living fiber, extremely difficult to split in warm weather, but a good "twice-warming" workout.  Oak stumps averaged 20-25" diameter, but some hit 35" or more.  Sad to say, they all had to go -- oak wilt or other forest maladies.  Little wood-knockin' hobby has two goals: beat middle age (God willing) & heat home with clean hardwoods all winter.  Custom high-tech Revere wood stove is more than 75% efficient, & puts virtually zero smoke into the air after startup, only CO2, water & trace hydrocarbons.  Heats 2 of the 3 floors, 2400 square feet to 72 degrees F., in less than 2 hours.  Next to zero creosote in flue.  System never needs a chimney sweep.  Fun in the sun occurred summer 2002.  Then in October 2007, hand-split & stacked 1,400 lbs of raw red oak with rough 'n' ready sons Jack & Bo; total work time = 7 hours.  U.S. Dive Travel's team leader wishes all of our loyal clients countless years of glad adventures in the sun & wind, under the Big Blue Sky !</FONT><BR>
