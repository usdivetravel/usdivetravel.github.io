La Concha Beach Resort Package includes: Lodging (double-occupancy) in the premier

dive resort of Mexico's Baja Peninsula + 2-tank boat diving days with Cortez

Club, Baja's most respected scuba diving company + snacks &amp; refreshments

aboard the dive vessel. Transfers are an extra cost with these Baja vacations, as is Mexico's federal sales tax --

currently 12% on all hotel-based resort services in La Paz, Baja California.</P>



<P>Located 900 miles South of San Diego &amp; about 100 miles north of

Cabo San Lucas on the eastern coast of Mexico's Baja Peninsula, right on

the Sea of Cortez, La Paz is our vote for the best-value dive vacation destination

in all of Mexico. One of the safest, too.  It's easy to fly to Baja California in Mexico, & easy to stay there, but hard to leave

the place. Prices in La Paz are low, &amp; spirits are high among the gracious townspeople

&amp; La Concha Beach Resort staff. The underwater thrills in Sea of Cortez diving are endless for scuba lovers,

whale watchers &amp; casual snorkelers alike.  Baja diving is not a coral experience, but a big sea animal 

adventure.</P>



<P>Mexico's Sea of Cortez is famous among U.S. scuba divers for the thrilling

big-animal sightings it offers nearly all year around, with vast schools

of peaceful hammerhead sharks, sometimes several hundred at a time, circling

overhead like eerie silent starships.   In a sense, Baja diving is really known for 

these hammerhead sharks in schools, plus the seals & sea lions, more than any other factors.  

Since most dive guides we know agree that Baja diving really has its epicenter in LaPaz diving, 

this is one of the two key nerve centers for serious quality Mexican scuba diving.

Divers also relish their close encounters

with a myriad playful marine mammals -- from seals to sea lions -- which

cavort around rock rookeries &amp; sea mounts just off the coast. The seals

will swim up to you &amp; clown around like impish children right in your

face mask. Even the huge blubbery sea lions, who weigh hundreds of pounds,

swim with the grace &amp; power of submarine ballet artists, swooshing

only yards away in friendly circles.  That's the essence of Sea of Cortez diving.

The Bottom Line is Baja diving means dive vacations with the Big Critters !

And Sea of Cortez diving is pretty tough to beat, any season of the year, 

for low-cost + high value.   Now there's more to Baja vacations than scuba diving with hammerhead sharks...</P>



<P>Yes, there are two more creatures that fuel the imaginations of scuba diving enthusiasts 

even more keenly. From December through February each year, hundreds of

Pacific gray whales migrate south from Alaskan &amp; Pacific Northwest
waters, down to the Sea of Cortez. These lively pods of gray whales transform

many shallow inlets along the coast near La Paz into awe-inspiring whale

nurseries. The warm, calm waters of the Sea of Cortez are ideal for sheltering

the gray whales calves, &amp; for new breeding as well. Talk about pure mammal attraction. 

The whale watching here can be positively awe-inspiring some weeks in winter.  

During this prime winter window of weather, gray whale watching is the lifeblood of 

the Sea of Cortez around La Paz, & especially at La Concha Beach Resort.</P>



<P>Sometimes this dive resort's day trips can get you close enough to these gentle

giants to almost reach out &amp; touch them from over your gunwale. By

early March, the magnificent &amp; vastly intelligent gray whales begin their

long swim northward to Alaskan waters again, filling the ocean with plaintive,

otherworldly squeaks &amp; piping cries. Maybe they're saying &quot;so

long amigos, see you next winter.&quot; To see gray whales this close

is a whale watching adventure that will transfix your heart for one eternal moment, &amp;

will transform forever your perspective on man's place on this fragile

planet. Whale watching is as much a spiritual experience as it is an 

emotional recharging.  

Outside of places like La Paz &amp; stateside movie theaters, few scuba 

divers or tropical vacationers ever are blessed to see a gray whale &quot;up close &amp; personal.&quot;

Go for it! </P>



<P>But there's more to Big Critter central than whale watching.  Someday, you may be lucky enough to see the elusive &quot;Senor Big,&quot;

largest fish in any ocean -- the tranquil &amp; harmless whale shark. These

mammoth fish can measure up to 40 feet long &amp; they can weigh tons,

but they're meek vegetarians so have no fear of the whale shark! It's tough to see the shy

whale shark, but those scuba divers fortunate enough to see them will never forget

that day -- when a living wall glided serenely past then vanished with

the broad flick of a tail the size of a sports car. Of course, we cannot

promise that you'll get to see whale sharks, or waltz with &quot;Meester Beeg,&quot; but some

of our clients have nabbed this rare &amp; magical opportunity &amp; returned

home stateside with glowing photos of whale sharks &amp; some major "fish stories" to boot.</P>



<P>For sheer economy -- air tickets, meals &amp; dives -- La Paz in Mexico's Sea of Cortez region is one

of the best-value warm water dive destinations anywhere in the world, for

West Coast divers especially. Round-trip air tickets from L.A. are often right around $300 - $400 pp 

or less. And land costs are amazingly affordable. You can grab three great

meals a day for less than USD $25 per person, which is about one third

the cost you'll find on many Caribbean resort islands. Also, all of La

Concha Beach Resort's comfy rooms are facing the ocean, with gorgeous water views &amp;

an excellent sandy beach only a stroll away.</P>



<P>La Concha Beach Resort is a quintessential bargain. There are 107 air-conditioned

rooms &amp; suites, all with color TV, phone &amp; charming decor. There

are swimming &amp; Jacuzzi pools right next to the beach. You can rent

or charter paddle boards, kayaks, wave runners, water-skiing trips, day

sailing trips, snorkeling trips, whale-watching adventures, half-day scuba

trips &amp; sunset cruises. There are shops nearby where you can rent wind-surfing

boards, or charter a deep-sea marlin fishing expedition. La Concha Beach Resort also

features tennis courts, a fine little restaurant, video rentals, nightclub,

on-site car rentals &amp; a classic Mexican fiesta every Saturday evening.

You want it, La Paz has it.  Baja vacations do not come any better than this, we feel.</P>



<P>With its high-beamed ceilings in the lodge, &amp; thatched-palm palapas

along the waterfront, La Concha Beach Resort blends Old World rustic charm &amp; New

World streamlined elegance. It just feels good to stay here at La Concha Resort. Relaxation

&amp; peace are the ruling energies of the village. La Paz natives are

kind &amp; friendly &amp; their attentive spirit makes you want to return

for more. This is a perfect way to escape the party-hearty scuba legions

that are crowding &amp; sullying many corners of the Caribbean nowadays.

La Paz is Mexico's last best secret. Shhhhh!!!  We do NOT want this beautiful locale to be trampled by tourist hordes, the way Cozumel & Cancun have been ruined since the late 1990s.  La Paz is still an old-fashioned wonderfully serene Mexican town, & we hope it stays that way for all time to come.  <I> Buena suerte, che' ! </I></P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT>

<P>All Baja diving package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging & diving prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; & that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our Baja diving vacation experts normally secure wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing for Baja vacation packages -- not any travel professionals. </P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above Baja scuba diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At many dive resorts, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International &amp; commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $45 per person for the land portion + $20 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. </P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for all Baja dive resorts & Baja side tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest & our prices the lowest in this industry, & thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa & Mastercard. </P>

<P>Remember, all Baja diving vacation clients to all foreign destinations will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $30 - $40 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; & away you go. Best of luck with your dive travel plans. We hope your Baja scuba diving vacation is a safe & satisfying adventure. Blessings & best wishes with ALL your Baja dive vacations.</P>
