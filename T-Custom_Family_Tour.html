dive clubs, private social clubs, office buddies &amp; groups of friends,

we've reprinted here below an actual itinerary of a family group whom we

guided on a 10-day adventure vacation not long ago. Below our introduction

here, we've reprinted the pre-trip planning memo that we mailed out to

get everybody revved up &amp; prepared. Their trip to the peaceful Bay Islands

of Honduras was a delight and a success in all four ways that matter most:</FONT><BR>

</P>



<UL>

<LI>Each client's per-capita tab came in at least  $200

below normal retail for spring prices on their host island, after <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">WILD&nbsp;ISLAND&nbsp;EXPEDITIONS

</FONT></B>secured a special group discount at the resort plus wholesale

air tickets. As a whole, the family group saved nearly $2,000.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Folks all said they had a wonderful time. The

diving was superb, aided by good weather.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Everybody stayed safe &amp; healthy -- no urchin

handshakes, no intestinal cha-chas. </FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>The personal dynamics of the group were hassle-free

&amp; blessed with good humor.</FONT><BR>

</LI>

</UL>



<P>Here's how the Amosi Family's booking process

worked, so you can see how smoothly their advance planning, &amp; their

trip itself, flowed along from A to Z. We have changed the family names

&amp; a few minor details to protect their privacy, but the actual itinerary is copied straight from 

USDT's group-tour files, verbatim. </FONT><BR>

</P>



<P>The father of the extended family, Dr. Amosi,

is a thoughtful &amp; life-positive guy who proved to be a joy to work

with. He telephoned U.S. Dive Travel near the first of the year to ask

for help in organizing a special family adventure overseas. We talked with

him for about an hour as he sifted through various options. There was no

rush, we assured him -- &quot;just take your time &amp; highlight your

priorities for us.&quot; Dr. Amosi asked us to search out 3 or 4 resort

options that offered high-quality diving at a fair price, with

reasonable airfares from Seattle.</FONT><BR>

</P>



<P>That afternoon we assembled a detailed information

portfolio on resorts in Belize, Honduras, Mexico &amp; Hawaii -- with color

brochures &amp; in-depth fact sheets -- &amp; mailed it off right away.

Dr. Amosi received the packet within 48 hours of his phone call.</FONT><BR>

</P>



<P>About a week later he called us &amp; asked for

an appointment. We had time open later that week &amp; set the meeting

forthwith. Four members of the family, a kind of &quot;vacation recon&quot;

team, drove about 80 miles to visit our former main office in downtown Seattle. 

It was a fun afternoon, about 2.5

hours together, punctuated with easygoing humor &amp; spirited questions.

We gave the family members a thorough presentation with color slides, brochures

&amp; maps. The clients relaxed &amp; asked all the questions they needed,

in a low-key &amp; low-pressure environment. Then they bid us adieu.</FONT><BR>

</P>



<P>Two weeks later Dr. Amosi called us back &amp;

hired <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">WILD&nbsp;ISLAND&nbsp;EXPEDITIONS </FONT></B>to

provide a guided diving &amp; cultural tour to Honduras. He paid the deposits

for 10 divers, picking a great little inn, NAUTILUS DIVE RESORT, on the

unspoiled island of Guanaja in the Bay Islands of Honduras. Then 70 days

before departure the Amosi family paid in full, as per USDT terms &amp;

conditions. USDT's guide flew to Guanaja a few days before their arrival

to prep the resort for them. Here's the memo he mailed them just before

he left Seattle. </FONT><BR>

</P>



<P>All scuba divers, please remember to bring your

diving certification cards, your passports, your driver's license &amp;

greenbacks or US travelers checks for emergency money or side expenses.

US currency is readily accepted all over Honduras, but travelers checks

are safest. Also remember to carry your regulators, dive computers, plus

other fragiles &amp; valuables with you on the plane as you depart Seattle,

or Portland. It's safer that way.</FONT><BR>

</P>



<P>Bring mucho bug spray. Also bring American snack

foods such as dried fruits, candy bars, fruit tarts, beef jerky -- if you

crave such goodies frequently. Avon Skin-So-Soft works great against the

no-see-ums &amp; mosquitoes, though some wags suggest it makes you smell

like a French cathouse. Call Almar or me to fax you a copy of the trip

preparation checklists I gave the family several months ago, just in case

you still haven't seen one.</FONT><BR>

</P>



<P>Be sure to get malaria prophylaxis &amp; any

other shots your doctor recommends. Ask your doctor about the good old

classic chloroquine for malaria prevention. It's safe &amp; you need only

one tablet the week before you leave, one each week while you're abroad,

&amp; one each week for about 5 weeks after you return. Pack light. Just

a few T shirts, shorts &amp; sandals are fine. It will be warm &amp; summery.

May is usually the ideal month to be diving in the Bay Islands. You all

picked a winner! You're in for Big Fun on de Bayou.</FONT><BR>

</P>



<P>And remember the Hessburg Hat Guarantee. After

the trip's over, if you honestly believe that you had a lousy time, speak

up &amp; John will fork over a few bucks to buy the hat of your choice

in San Pedro. In full view of everybody, camcorders whirring, John will

eat one hefty bite of that hat for you, to atone for his sins of earthly

imperfection.</FONT><BR>

as part of their package: 3 meals per day, dbl-occup rooms with sweeping

dives per day (assuming weather &amp; currents allow). All other items

such as alcoholic beverages &amp; soft drinks, or side trips such as deep-sea

fishing &amp; sailing, will be offered at nominal extra charges. Each person

also will have to pay about $20 US airport departure tax upon leaving Honduras.

This is for your exit visa -- standard stuff.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>There are no roads on Guanaja Island, &amp;

only a few phones, no shopping centers, no nightclubs, no industry &amp;

no pollution, only heavenly peace &amp; quiet &amp; a refreshing old-world

way of life not much different from what it was five decades ago. You want

nighttime action? A Club Med this is not. This is Honduras &amp; that's

why we're going! It's old-fashioned &amp; that's great. Anyway, back to

the nocturnal jollies issue.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Try taking a water taxi (maybe $10 a head round-trip)

over to the old Bonacca Cay, where about 2,000 people live in an old-world

stilt village atop an island smaller than 100 acres. There are two wonderfully

cheesy discos on Bonacca -- like Saturday Night Fever on the Planet Bizarro.

You'll love the very retro mirror-faceted revolving globe, the 70s &amp;

80s music, &amp; apple-cheeked young teens gallivanting while their folks

pretend to look the other way as the ingenuous mating rituals unfold. It's

really high camp &amp; a lot of good clean fun. Cheap too. The local beers

are outstanding. </FONT><BR>
