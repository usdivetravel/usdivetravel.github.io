TRAVEL INSURANCE ADVISORY</FONT></FONT></B></P>
</center>


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Whether or not you choose to purchase travel

insurance, please read this entire advisory document carefully.&nbsp; Then

sign it &amp; return it to the address below, along with your USDT Registration

+ Liability Release forms. Thank you very much for your time & thoughtfulness.</FONT></B></P>



<P>When experienced adventure travelers visit remote or undeveloped locations

overseas, they know it makes good economic sense to protect their gear

&amp; luggage, &amp; their valuable trip investment -- the lodging, dive

packages, side-tours &amp; air tickets. The best way to secure this protection

is to buy, right when you tender your first deposits, a sensible travel insurance package. We are not trying to sell you 

travel insurance.  In fact, USDT does not sell travel insurance for self-evident ethical reasons.  (Please

see the Travel Insurance hot-link on our USDT Home Page.)



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
However, since Sept. 11, 2001 -- the need for travel cancellation insurance is greater now than ever, because of the new complexity of many expensive adventure trips, because airlines can be vexingly unreliable with their random flight cancellations, & because the world is not always a safe place.  Here is why we encourage you to get travel insurance on your own.  Bottom line -- USDT is not a bank, & therefore we keep virtually no cash reserves on hand, no money in escrow for clients. We are required by contract to remit client funds properly, sending your payments overseas as soon as we receive them.  And we do so, without exception, for all clients.  
Therefore once we comply with our fiduciary responsibility & send your payments overseas, if the vessel or resort 
you want to visit defaults on you -- a situation beyond our control -- it is virtually impossible to secure a 
refund from that overseas service provider.  We alert you to this potential problem NOT to create anxiety, rather to 
help focus your awareness so you can protect your valuable vacation investment more vigorously.  <B>Summary:  please get your own travel cancellation insurance right when you pay your first deposit.  Do not procrastinate until just before you depart your hometown.  The reason is simple & powerful.  If you DO secure travel cancellation insurance, for example, & a random hurricane demolishes your resort 3 months before you were scheduled to visit, then you still will be fully covered under most travel insurance plans.  We recommend you ALWAYS buy your travel insurance immediately upon tendering the first deposit, if the insurance carrier allows.  Smart travelers never procrastinate. </B>Travel cancellation insurance is easy to purchase.
