Every week at the St. Paul, MN office of <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S.

Dive Travel </FONT></B>we receive phone calls from across the USA, from Canada & also Europe,

from divers interested in becoming tour group leaders for our guide service.

Since 1991, we have assembled a highly-trained, dependable cadre of dive instructors &amp;

divemasters across North America & Western Europe who organize groups for us -- most from within

dive clubs, dive shops or private groups of diving buddies. </P>



<P>Many of these well-motivated tour leaders will travel 1 to 3 times 

a year to tropical islands for us, taking typical groups of 8-15 divers,

&amp; often several non-diver spouses. Some groups are substantially larger.  We very much enjoy our association

with these tour leaders. <BR>

</P>



<P>They work hard gathering their team, prepping the paperwork &amp; spearheading

the creative marketing necessary for groups to coalesce. That's why we

reward these guides well for their labors. Because these independent contractor

guides are one mainstay of our growing wholesale business, we at <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.

S. DIVE TRAVEL</FONT></B> whenever possible give the group leaders free

land or live-aboard packages &amp; super-low wholesale net rates on their

group's airfares.<BR>

the USDT group. Clients also benefit from a highly motivated, professional &amp;

enthusiastic tour guide to take the planning stress off their shoulders,

</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">1. </FONT></B>In some select markets in the South Pacific, for example, we'll sell you the air tickets,

whenever space &amp; contracts permit, at straight wholesale rates-- plus

our minimal markup -- allowing you to offer your dive buddies tremendous

savings. Some trips <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">you can mark the air tickets up

as much as $70 - $80 per ticket </FONT></B>to each client<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">

</FONT></B>&amp; still beat the airline's lowest retail price by $50 or

more.  (This volatile market changes daily, just like the stock market, amigos.)  These are savings that solo clients normally could not have secured

on their own in the retail marketplace. We grant these discounts only to

groups of sufficient size (usually no fewer than 10 - 12 persons). This markup

margin is money you can use to defray your own air ticket cost.<BR>

We can offer free land packages (lodging &amp; diving) to the leader of

any independent travel group that books group air &amp; land through us,

to many of our prime destinations. That means we'd like to encourage any

experienced divemaster or instructor with a dream destination to consider

organizing your own group. It'll be the best &amp; most satisfying vacation

you ever experience. Here's a succinct summary of how the system works for you. 

These are merely helpful examples, as USDT can arrange superior group discounts at any of hundreds of resorts worldwide, in the 30+ countries we represent contractually.

News for Non-Scuba Clients</FONT></B>: USDT is always happy to work with

any person who wants to organize a non-diving group vacation to any tropical

destination. For example, let's say an uncle plans a 34-person family reunion

(complete with kids) for a beachfront resort in Kailua-Kona of Hawaii,

highlighted by a couple days of boat-based snorkeling or deep-sea fishing.

Or maybe an office professional gathers 12 co-workers for a deluxe snorkeling

trip to the Belize Barrier Reef. With easygoing vacation trips of this

sort, where technical liability is minimal, the group leader can ignore

USDT's listed requirements # 1, #4, #5, #8 &amp; #14. Therefore, the non-diving

group organizer can enjoy the same resort or vessel discounts we offer

to dive tour leaders, with almost no paperwork required. In most cases

of large groups, after the group leader's trip is paid for, there still

remains ample savings to share among all group members. <BR>

</FONT></FONT></B>Always alert for a better deal, some assertive travel

shoppers may challenge you as tour leader &amp; ply you with these questions,

&quot;Why should I bother traveling with your guided tour, since you as

group leader are buying both land &amp; air reservations wholesale from

USDT then marking the total package up to us as clients? Can't USDT give

me the same discount deal as you got, if my partner &amp; I just book directly

with them?&quot;<BR>

</P>



<P>The answer is a simple &amp; emphatic, &quot;No.&quot; <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">It's

best to be frank with your clients.</FONT></B> Show them this list below.

If they complain, keep your TLC quotient high, but be firm on facts. Show

them how you're helping them save money, even though you will mark up their

package a fair &amp; reasonable margin to defray your organizing costs.

With most bookings at resorts or on vessels where USDT holds a wholesale

contract, if clients don't have a large group behind them, they simply

cannot match the savings that members of a group will enjoy. For small

groups, the resort or vessel would never cut them a deal better than the

regular retail price. (Normally, USDT defines a group as 10 or more clients

plus the leader.) Here's how the system works, amigos, where USDT holds

wholesale contracts: <BR>

</P>



<UL>

<LI>When any solo client, or couple, or small group books a trip through

USDT, we always try to charge the lowest retail price available on the

open market, plus tax &amp; service fee. That's only fair. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">But

couples can't hope to match the purchasing power of a group. </FONT></B>Consider

this hypothetical example. If you go to a computer store &amp; buy a top-notch

printer for your home system, you'll pay $ X. But if you buy 12 printers,

one for each department of your business, you may pay only $ X minus 25%.

Fair again, right? <BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>USDT's price structures are designed to <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">favor

group leaders &amp; their tour members.</FONT></B> That's because USDT

is willing to sell air &amp; land to the group leader at a per-client profit

margin much lower than we could tolerate with solos, couples or small groups.

If a group leader sends us lots of good people, we can afford to take a

calculated loss in normal profit on each person, to reward the leader's

work, since he's making up for that per-client loss with volume. Therefore,

if any prospective client's vacation dates match those of a USDT group

already being organized, that client would do well to join up.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">To be fair to tour organizers</FONT></B> who

devote long hours to gathering their groups, our net rate to them is a

specially negotiated discount price that no solo diver, nor couple, nor

any small-group of retail clients ever can secure by booking directly with

USDT. It would be economically infeasible -- &amp; as Mr. Spock says &quot;illogical&quot;

-- to do otherwise. <BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>In special cases, sometimes USDT can negotiate an <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">exceptional

ad hoc discount</FONT></B> (with a better-than-wholesale net rate) for

a group leader -- with a resort, vessel or dive operation owner with whom

of clients is booked. Call us for details: <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">952-953-4124.</FONT></B>

</FONT></FONT></B>If you're an Advanced or Rescue certified diver &amp;

you're about to sign up for your Divemaster course, here's a little item

to assist you in hitting the deck running. One requirement that PADI &amp;

NAUI, the top certification companies in North America, will insist upon

is that you complete a comprehensive emergency plan for handling scuba-related

rescues at your local level. It might sound easy but consider the context.<BR>

</P>



<P>After months of slogging through your pool work &amp; open water checkout

dives with basic students, while juggling your work &amp; social lives,

&amp; keeping the ol' dog walked &amp; the lawn mowed, you'll likely be

bushed. Trust us, we've been there. So here's a bit of good news.<BR>

</P>



<P>Feel free to crib any ideas you need from this model emergency plan

we developed for our own Divemaster course in Puget Sound. Of course, the

obvious specifics will vary from city to city (emergency numbers, etc.)

but this plan will highlight the basics.<BR>

</P>



<P>Hope this encourages you to jump in &amp; tackle the exciting Divemaster

curriculum with some gusto. Don't worry, you'll do an excellent job! It's

really a lot of fun &amp; not as tough as you might expect. The challenge

is stimulating. The professional diver certification card represents an

achievement, &amp; an honor, that will last you a lifetime. Go for it!<BR>

</P>



<P>If you live in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan or Australia, 
<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>call

us at 952-953-4124</FONT></FONT></B> &amp; we'll help connect you to a

top-flight PADI instructor who can give you an excellent Divemaster course.

Then once you get your Divemaster card, the hardest part is over. Just

make a few phone calls to line up some dive buddies &amp; you may be on

your way to becoming one of our hard-working (&amp; well-pampered) team

of overseas tour guides. Here goes.....</P>
