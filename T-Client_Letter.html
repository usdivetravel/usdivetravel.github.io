<p>The rhythm of our professional lives is simple & consistent, year after year, for the last 23 years.  We spend the peak rez-booking season -- from mid-August through fall, winter & spring to mid-June -- at "U.S. DIVE TRAVEL / East" in the Twin Cities, Minnesota USA, fielding client calls, working with solos, couples & groups across Europe & North America, matching their visions to dream destinations worldwide.  From mid-June through mid-August we travel the breadth of our contract properties across the Caribbean & Pacific, working much of each summer at "U.S. DIVE TRAVEL / West" on O'ahu island in the Hawaiian Isles.  O'ahu is a picture-perfect locale for us, a convenient hub for our Pacific property inspection tours to island nations from Oz to Fiji; & also an ideal place to keep current with our training, dive skills & "continuing ed" in the underwater realm.</p>





<P>To serve you better, we have mastered the art of low-cost high adventure

during more than 38 years of world travel to many countries throughout

Latin America &amp; the Pacific Rim aka Oceania. Our owners normally are overseas for

several months each year on business travel, so economizing is more than a passing

interest for us. Our company's dive travel associates have learned many special techniques to trim

our own costs overseas, while still ensuring full safety &amp; comfort.

And we use all these techniques to help you, too.  When you book a scuba diving trip with 

U.S. DIVE TRAVEL you always get the "Family Deal."  The way we extend special

courtesies &amp; perks to our immediate family when they ask us to plan their tropical travel --

that's the same up-front, TLC treatment all USDT clients get, all seasons.<BR>

</P>



<P>At U.S. Dive Travel we know that we are nothing without you, our valued

<b>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S. Dive Travel is one of few adventure travel

wholesalers <BR>in North America who can offer you all of these Five

Special Services:</FONT></B><BR>

</P>



<P>1. <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We meet any &amp; all local clients who so request</FONT></B>,

in person, at your home or office, if the group is 20 committed clients or larger.  All meetings are by advance appointment

only, &amp; are based on time slot-availability during high season (November through April). 

For groups of 20 or more committed clients, we'll even give you

a private slide show &amp; video presentation, with Q &amp; A, at your

home or workplace. <BR>

</P>



<P>2. <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We offer qualified price protection on puddle jumper air

tickets</FONT></B>, wherever we hold a wholesale air contract to your destination.

Once you commit to our best price quote &amp; pay us for your air tickets,

if we were not able to secure wholesale seats for you right then, because

they'd sold out for your chosen dates, we may be able to wait-list you until about

four weeks before you depart. Then we'll alert you if these discount seats

re-appear. For example, an out-of-state dive travel competitor might suddenly release

a large block of seats they've been holding for weeks, because a dive tour group

canceled. These seats pop up in our computer system &amp; we alert you

immediately.</P>



<P>3.<FONT COLOR="#0000A0"> If you need to update your scuba diving  gear</FONT></B>,

we'll help connect you to reputable experts who frequently can secure the

rock-bottom lowest prices in the nation for quality brands.  By

the rules of our travel partnership, <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S. Dive

Travel </FONT></B>takes zero commissions for these gear referrals. We do

it for you. We're glad to take the time to help you secure new gear that

will enhance your safety &amp; enjoyment. All we ask is: tell a friend

about us. </P>



<P>4. <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We take care to hone even the smallest details

for you.</FONT></B> For example, we'll give you impeccably organized pre-trip checklists

to help you plan what scuba gear &amp; peripherals to take, what shots to get, whom to call for

visa questions, &amp; how to find the best deals in travel insurance. Nothing

is left to chance. Well nothing except the weather &amp; bugs.</P>



<P>5. We are the largest & most experienced tropical adventure-travel planning agency in the Central USA, in the region that extends from 1,000 miles east of the Mississipi River to 1,000 miles west of the Mississippi.  Many preferred clients over the last 2 decades regard us as <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">North America's 

leading experts on resort-based scuba diving, &amp; shore diving in the</FONT></B>

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Hawaiian Islands</FONT></B>. After more than 23 extended 3-6 week visits from the mainland & about 40 island-specific dive tours

since 1990 to the isles of Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Maui, Molokai, Lanai

&amp; Hawaii (The Big Island), we know scores of secret spots the guidebooks

missed -- from the best hide-away beaches, to the best shore diving coves,

to the best-value small hotels &amp; dive operations. <BR>

</P>


<b><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"> 
<P>There's another way we try to put respect for

our dive travel clients before unvarnished profit.</FONT></B><BR>

</P>



<P>Consider this question <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">-- do you really need

travel insurance? </FONT></B>In most cases it's a very wise idea.

We'll take the time to give you solid advice &amp; a list of America's

top travel insurance firms, including their 1-800 numbers so you can save

a buck or two on your call. Though most of our dive travel competitors sell

cancellation insurance, we at <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S. Dive Travel

</FONT></B>do not feel ethically comfortable doing so.<BR>

</P>



<P>The way we see it: here you are about to spend a lot of money on a dive trip

that by its very nature is riskier than beach basking in the Florida Keys. Therefore,

you already know there's a small risk to scuba diving. So for us to drub

a sense of mishap anxiety into you before your dive trip, then try to sell you

something to assuage that anxiety, seems like snake oil salesmanship.

We just want to improve the security of your dive vacation. Our goal is

to earn your respect, your friendship &amp; your trust, so that

down the line we may be blessed with your repeat dive travel business. With more than two decades of successful dive travel

experience behind us, we can guarantee

you fast &amp; friendly service, expert advice, extremely competitive prices

&amp; even more. <BR>

<LI>Third, <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">respecting the ancient maritime cultures &amp;

</P>



<P>General manager of the dive travel service, John Hessburg is trained in

land &amp; ocean rescue, &amp; is fluent in Spanish &amp; Brazilian Portuguese, conversant

in classical German. A native of St. Paul, Minnesota, John moved to Seattle in '82, then back to St. Paul in June '99 after his 

father suffered a serious heart problem.  

With wife, Susan, he fell in love with the Pacific &amp; founded <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Wild

Island Expeditions </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT>&amp; later that guide service grew into the present-day <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S.

Dive Travel </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT> in April '91.<BR>

</P>



<P>John has led dozens of land-based expeditions &amp; tours abroad for

more than 38 years. These include more than 40 dive trips to various Hawaiian Islands,

7 dive trips to the South Pacific, one to the Arabian Peninsula, many to Mexico &amp; the Western

Caribbean, three mountaineering expeditions to remote sectors in the Argentine

&amp; Bolivian Andes, several trekking &amp; photo trips throughout South

America, two whitewater &amp; voyageur canoe expeditions in the wilderness

of Ontario, two long-distance bike tours of Canada &amp; California, plus

countless scores of rock &amp; ice climbs in the Colorado &amp; Canadian Rockies

&amp; the Cascades. John also has completed 19 cross-country ski marathons

(50-55 kilometers) back in MN &amp; WI since 1977.<BR>

</P>



<P>A native of windward Oahu in Hawaii, Susan Hessburg is a PADI-certified

diver, who with John has made dozens of adventure trips back to the Hawaiian

Islands since 1990. Susan has climbed three of the tallest glaciated peaks

in the Cascade Range &amp; a number of smaller ones. While keeping the

company books &amp; computer system on track, Susan &amp; John also are

raising two livewire boys: Jack  &amp; Robert Marcus. <BR>

</P>



<P>Between dive tours, John is perpetually re-writing his first book, a politically

incorrect look at the spirit &amp; humor of adventure travel in some of

the world's most fascinating &amp; off-beat cultures. Before founding <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.

S. Dive Travel</FONT></B>, John Hessburg graduated summa cum laude & Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota School of Journalism in Minneapolis, then worked for 15 years as an investigative

reporter &amp; news writer for several magazines &amp; daily newspapers

across the USA.  That first career spanned nearly nine years as a staff writer at the

metro daily, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. John also served as a Pacific Northwest 

correspondent for Reuters, the British international news agency, during those 9 years at the Post.  

In the 1980s, he was twice

nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, one time solo for a feature piece about America's Vietnam years, 

& once as member of a team analyzing a Mt. Hood climbing tragedy that claimed several young students. 

John won about a dozen state &amp; regional

reporting awards in Minnesota &amp; Washington states, including Minnesota's highest honor for investigative journalism -- the Frank Premack Award in 1981.<BR>

</P>



<P>One series of about 25 stories in the Seattle morning newspaper, published

in the late 1980s, exposed rampant timber theft on U.S. Forest Service

lands in Washington, Oregon &amp; Alaska, which for decades had cost American

taxpayers millions of dollars a year. Prodded by those stories, &amp; public

outcry over Forest Service malfeasance, Congress eventually passed strict new 

laws regulating timber sale accountability. Now logging in America's national

forests falls under far tighter law enforcement scrutiny, to protect vulnerable

public resources from a corrupt old-boys network of timber pirates that used to

prey at will on the Pacific Northwest. <BR>

<P>In a lighter vein, <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S. Dive Travel's</FONT></B>

co-director Susan Hessburg, whose hobbies include gourmet Asian &amp; Mediterranean

cooking, back-country skiing &amp; old-country cross-stitching, worked

more than seven years as senior sales coordinator for a successful manufacturer's

rep firm in Seattle. She is our accounting &amp; organizational maven; &amp; can juggle 4 or 5 several key 

tasks at once with accuracy &amp; aplomb.  (Raising two testosterone-driven sons who, like their parents, live at about 120 mph, is good practice 

for any office manager!)<BR>
