<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000FF"><B>Lions Dive & Beach Resort</B></FONT> </B>is made to order for scuba divers &amp; snorkelers. We & our agents, & our group guides, have seen a great many Pacific & Caribbean dive resorts over the last decade of tropical island inspections. We know a good bargain in dive resorts when we find one, after more than 39 years of adventure travel experience. Lions Dive Resort offers the best-value 4-star resort locale on Curacao, hands down, we feel. The "bang for the buck" factor here is high, all the way around, from scuba diving options to onsite restaurant to quality lodging to warmly hospitable service. This hotel's best advantages to both are easy safe access to scuba diving from shore, basically gentle currents for snorkeling &amp; for kids playing in the surf, excellent affordability &amp; the professionalism of both resort &amp; diving staff. Lions Dive Resort is a great little locale &amp; one of the prime southern Caribbean in dive resorts available anywhere this year.  This place is THE deal for Caribbean dive vacations in the ABC Islands, & that holds for snorkeling afficionados, too.</P>

<P>Lions Dive Resort also is ideal for novice divers who want to get their feet wet, without wild currents &amp; overly strenuous scuba diving challenges. This is a fabulous place to learn the scuba diving ropes, &amp; still see some wonderful sealife in the process. Few dive resorts we rep in the Caribbean offer such a wide array of options to both scuba divers &amp; snorkelers, so Lions Dive & Beach Resort seems a good bet for larger groups that include divers, non-divers, seniors &amp; children of any age. Simply put, if one person in a couple, for example, would rather go snorkeling while his / her spouse relishes the excellent Curacao scuba diving, there are plenty of easy, accessible choices for enthusiasts of both watersports.  This tropical island is your oyster!</P>

<P>Another advantage to the Lions Dive Resort location in the ABC Islands is this: Cura&ccedil;ao is outside the hurricane belt in the southern Caribbean, which means you can take scuba vacations there from June through November with very little chance of any tropical storm interrupting your scuba diving or snorkeling fun. Curacao is located 60 miles from Venezuela, between Aruba &amp; Bonaire -- nestled right in the diving brisket of the ABC Islands.  This hotel is 20 miles from the Airport, 5 miles east from Willemstad, plus it offers accessible beach &amp; ocean front next to the Seaquarium &amp; at the National Underwater Park. Since there's more to Caribbean dive vacations than scuba diving or snorkeling, this is a wonderful advantage & a time-saver for families on the go.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike some dive resorts, here's how the beachfront access works at this tropical island resort. As a guest of the Lions Dive & Beach Resort, for years a scenic center in Curacao, you will receive an I.D. card upon check in. This card gives you free entrance to the Lions Dive Beach in front of the hotel &amp; to Cura&ccedil;ao's largest white sand beach named "Seaquarium Beach ", located next to the hotel. The beach is open from 8.00 AM till 6.00 PM. On the Lions Dive Beach, beach chairs for guests are free &amp; on Seaquarium Beach they are available for a small consideration.</P>

The management of the Lions Dive Resort is well aware that tourism can only survive in a world where good care is taken of nature &amp; the environment &amp; where the social &amp; cultural context are valued. That is precisely the attitude of the Cura&ccedil;ao islanders, who cherish their natural resources as much as the guests who come down to their dive resorts to enjoy them. Therefore the Lions Dive Resort tries to minimize impact on the environment by saving energy &amp; water, &amp; by reducing &amp; carefully processing waste products &amp; waste water. The tropical "feeling"  is serenely reflected in this resort's garden. We count on our guest to help us keep the hotel a fully natural place to stay, so future guests coming to the ABC Islands can enjoy a pristine environment on their own Caribbean scuba vacations.<BR>

a PADI 5-Star IDC Dive Center</B></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><BR>
</FONT>Ocean Encounters personalized service takes our guest to a great number of dive-sites. At Ocean Encounters, one of the most-respected scuba diving centers in the ABC Islands, our guests are our first priority. We have dives schedules every day. Choosing the dive site of the day is based on weather conditions, customer requests, &amp; divers skills. Ocean Encounters offers dives from walls &amp; coral gardens to sloping reefs &amp; wrecks. Experience the dive sites that make Curacao diving a top attraction among Caribbean scuba vacations. Such sites include our house reef at the Seaquarium, East Point, Lost Anchor, Barracuda point, Beacon Point, the wreck of the Superior Producer, Tugboat &amp; many more.  See what we mean about Curacao being one prime gem among Caribbean dive vacations.<BR>
<BR>

Ocean Encounters dive boats are built especially for Cura&ccedil;ao divers' needs. Each boat is certified &amp; adheres to all safety standards of the Coast Guard. They are equipped with features such as VHF radio, Oxygen kits, First Aid kits, &amp; life vests. All of the diving &amp; boat crew at Ocean Encounters are Medic First Aid &amp; DAN Oxygen certified. For your convenience camera rinse buckets are also available. Curacao diving is almost always stress-free, easy as munching a hothouse tomato &amp; very safe for new divers as well.  This is why scuba diving in the ABC Islands makes so much sense for novices, or persons who simply want a mellower beachside vacation without a lot of hassles in crowded dive boats.  No cattle-boat crowding here, funseekers.<BR>
<BR>

For the non-diver, we offer snorkeling from the dive boat at the dive site. Most of the dive sites make for great snorkeling at the outer reefs, walls, &amp; drop-offs. Snorkelers in Cura&ccedil;ao can taste the excitement of diving from the surface by experiencing colorful corals, &amp; a abundance of reef-fish.  That's why Curacao ranks well ahead of the other ABC islands in terms of total array of scuba diving options, we feel.<BR>
<BR>

Ocean Encounters commitment to personalized service is the keystone to our success. Hand-picking guides for their knowledge, enthusiasm &amp; commitment to excellent service. Ocean Encounters has build a first class team made up of PADI Instructors, PADI Divemasters, &amp; outstanding Boat-captains. Ocean Encounters can meet all diving enthusiasts' needs from the inexperienced to the most advanced diver who's been on many Caribbean scuba vacations.<BR>
<BR>

Additionally, Ocean Encounters offers all the PADI programs &amp; courses you'll ever want, ensuring your scuba vacations have a solid dive-pro backup. We have a knowledgeable &amp; professional trained staff, ready to support you, as you get wet with some cool Curacao diving at this gem of Caribbean dive resorts.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT></b>

<P>All dive package prices listed here, for Lion's Dive Hotel, are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging, side tour & diving prices are traditionally stable, as are live-aboard package prices; however air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard per FAA rules. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; & that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our  Curacao scuba diving vacation experts normally secure excellent wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  We can hold the line on pricing at dive resorts, such as Lion's Dive Hotel.  But remember please, the federal government has deregulated all U.S.-based airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals.  Early is good when seeking the best air ticket rates for your Caribbean dive vacations.</P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above scuba diving packages at Lion's Dive Resort are prices for only the live-aboard portion of your dive trip, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms.  On most live-aboards, there will be no triple-occupancy staterooms offered. International air tickets & commuter "island-hopper" seats are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets & the dive vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $55 per person for the land portion + $35 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. Solo clients may be rquired to pay a single supplement to secure a private room on this Curacao scuba diving vacation.</P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for our Curacao dive resorts, side tours & air ticket specials is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All Lion's Dive Resort clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer only. No personal checks will be accepted for the live-aboard or airline portion of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest & our prices the lowest in this industry, & thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin.</P>

<P>Remember, all tropical vacation clients at Lion's Dive Resort will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $30 - $40 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; & away you go. Best of luck with your dive travel plans. We hope your Curacao scuba diving vacation is a safe & satisfying adventure. Enjoy Lion's Dive Resort! </P>

<P>Best fishes too!</P>
