Pacific travel experts agree that this property is among the best-value 3-star resorts for tropical snorkeling &amp; scuba diving on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. HERON ISLAND RESORT offers vast acres of corals, stunning in brilliance

&amp; density. Many of the most vivid and visually engaging coralheads near HERON ISLAND RESORT are found



in only 2 - 4 meters of warm clear water, close offshore.  Plus there's plenty of exceptionally colorful boat



diving available near HERON ISLAND,  Australia, for vacationers who crave more color-rich scuba diving. With its many



options for private rooms &amp; suites, HERON ISLAND RESORT is comfortably designed for couples seeking romantic honeymoon



getaways or family scuba vacations. The subtly and frequently sheen-shifting turquoise hues of the HERON ISLAND lagoon are


relaxing &amp; re-energizing.  For new divers, this is one of the best snorkeling destinations + best dive resorts in the Western Pacific; &amp;  a 


perfect place for "Need-to-Get-Lost-in-the-Big-Blue" vacations.  Give HERON ISLAND RESORT a dive tour whirl.  And of course, g'dye mytes !

LIZARD ISLAND RESORT is one of the most renowned and sought-after 5-star luxury dive resorts in the world &amp; has been lauded  by international hotel-rating agencies &amp; travel magazines for  many years.



The  LIZARD ISLAND RESORT reputation has been as classic &amp; time-honored as that of Rolls Royce, Rolex or Remy-Martin. One friendly caveat: wise to begin your reservations process at least 8-10 months early, since the preferred rooms are very challenging to secure on an latecomer basis.  This is the unrivaled crown jewel of Australia's Great Barrier Reef &amp; is perfectly matched to  clients who demand nothing less than tropical vacation perfection -- from meals to amenities to the TLC client-attentive service.  There is no better resort island  on the Great Barrier Reef -- for snorkeling vacations or dive tours -- than  LIZARD ISLAND,  the epicenter of Queensland dive tours.  What's more, the resort regularly enacts a sweeping renovation project that only augments the brilliance of  LIZARD ISLAND RESORT.    We recommend  LIZARD ISLAND RESORT without reservation. (Actually mates, you must secure reservations, to be abso-bloomin-lutely precise. :)

Located on the South Shore of Bonaire, SAND DOLLAR CONDOMINIUMS are a spiffy 4-star resort with some of the easiest &amp; safest scuba diving from shore-- right next to the beach -- that you'll find anywhere in the Caribbean.  Aficionados of SAND DOLLAR CONDOMINIUMS know other great Bonaire dives are from boats 1/4 mile from shore, along the fringing reefs, or up in the remote countryside coves.  Sand Dollar is a dedicated haven for marine photography

buffs -- both scuba divers &amp; snorkelers. The prime claim to fame for

Sand Dollar Condominium Resort is that it's located on a  tract where beaches

are only 50 yards from the edge of a vast diving wall that stretches for

miles along southern Bonaire's protected shoreline. The South Bonaire water is warm,

the currents usually tame, &amp; the visibility often reaches 75-100 feet,

making Bonaire one of the Caribbean's most popular destinations for scuba divers

&amp; snorkelers.   SAND DOLLAR CONDOMINIUMS are affordable &amp; clean, the condos are quiet &amp; comfy; &amp; the management prides itself on TLC service with a careful eye for details.  The SAND DOLLAR CONDOMINIUMS dive shop is conveniently located right on site; &amp; many fun dive sites are only a few kick cycles from shore.  Sand Dollar Condominiums get our vote for a dependable family locale, with activities for kids &amp; plenty of safe beach play. SAND DOLLAR CONDOMINIUMS are not just for dive tours, they are perfect for dedicated beach baskers, too.  This  is a perfect locale for honeymooners, families &amp; snorkeling aficionados.

MATAVA RESORT is such a uniquely gifted green retreat, that it now ranks among our top seven small resorts anywhere in the Pacific.  MATAVA is run by purpose-driven men who refuse to fudge even a bit on what they know to be true: this beautiful planet is in trouble from careless developers & wanton resource sponges.  Thus it needs daily TLC, from every caring person, to restore a healthy balance.  These gents at MATAVA RESORT have green ethics down to a fun, unpretentious system.  MATAVA RESORT is the only vacation destination of note on the entire 65 km of nearly wilderness south Kadavu shoreline.  While MATAVA RESORT is a comfy 3½ star retreat, offering lush gardens, well-manicured lawns, delightfully rustic cabanas & meals to-die-for delicious, it is also the only resort close enough to the famed Astrolabe Reef to reach most dives in a wink.  The Astrolabe Reef is one the world's greatest living coral expanses.  The game fishing & snorkeling are amazing here!

There are 40 neatly built "tentalows" &amp; they are 100% comfortable, clean, right near the two pocket cove beaches. These sturdy high-walled canvas bungalows, stretched over aluminum frames, are built atop spacious wooden platforms with a bathroom, huge hotwater shower &amp; a private deck. The showers &amp; toilets are super-clean &amp; solar powered, designed impeccably for minimal impact on the earth. Honkin' healthy wild turkeys strut the grounds like they own the place, &amp; rare Hawaiian monk seals flop around happily all over the beaches, wherever they feel like planting their flubber. This is stylish tropical camping, amigos, &amp; perfect for families with kids, big church groups, or a passel of dive shop buddies from Michigan. It's a cool new take on 21st century camping.  MOLOKAI LODGE & KAUPOA BEACH CAMP, try these on for size, sunseekers.  We were amazed at the serenity and brilliance of the MOLOKAI LODGE on Molokai Ranch. This little island rocks!</P>

Prices at this classic historical LAHAINA INN are at least USD $140 per room night   <I>below </I>  the average lodging cost on Maui's famous Ka'anapali Coast, where the beautiful people pay  <I>  far  </I>  too much to play, wine & dine.

Clean, quiet, managed by pleasant folks who truly accommodate you, LAHAINA INN is nestled smack dab in the heart of this vibrant, colorful village.  LAHAINA INN is only walkin' minutes from all the nighttime action, the best restaurants, art galleries, shops & it's less than 3 blocks easy jaunt from the Lahaina Boat Harbor, where LAHAINA DIVERS two beautiful vessels are moored.  LAHAINA INN is a diamond amongst the pearls of West Maui's pricey luxury hotels, one of the best deals we have found on Maui in 15 years. Two big reasons why: meal costs & transportation costs are lower.  First, in Lahaina village you can walk almost everywhere you need to go.  Next, meals in Lahaina will run at least 25% - 30% more economical than in Wailea or the Ka'anapali Coast area.  What's more, this classic country-style guest inn is perfectly located  -- within quick strolling distance from the best scuba center in the village -- LAHAINA DIVERS.  We have worked with LAHAINA DIVERS for more than 14 years now, & since day one they have had the top-rated diving yachts on Maui -- big powerful Newton 46s -- the "Dauntless & the Dominion" -- with twin Cummins turbo-Diesel 430s.   A dive op that's respected widely in Hawaii, LAHAINA DIVERS has two strappin'  power yachts that are among the largest & fastest Coast Guard certified diving vessels in the Hawaiian Islands. At least 3-4 times a week there are exciting day trips from Maui across the big channel to dive at Lanai, the exclusive isle where Bill Gates was married.  Plus they visit the famous Molokini Crater, both inside & outside wall, several times a week. We have known Greg Howeth, the owner of LAHAINA DIVERS, for more than 14 years.  He is salt of the earth, salt of the sea, easy to work with & a gentleman of his word.  His crew is smart, savvy & friendly as the day is long.  These guys are pros, from guages to gunwales, & they have served scores of our good Maui diving clients since the early 1990s.  For scuba divers, LAHAINA DIVERS is the class act on the isle of Maui, plus our vote for <b>BEST DIVE SHOP in HAWAII</b>, period.

<b>COSTA RICA CANOPY TOURS, JUNGLE ECO-TOURS, VOLCANO TOURS.</b> </A></FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;
THE Original CANOPY TOUR&reg; is a new adventure sport, invented ( patent pending ) &amp; developed in Costa Rica by the company founder Darren Rennick. By modifying techniques and equipment originally used by spelunkers (cavers) &amp; canyon rappelers, THE original CANOPY TOUR&reg; company offers any adventurous tourist the opportunity to ascend into the forest canopy &amp; see jungle life from a perspective available previously to only a select few researchers &amp; photographers. THE CANOPY TOUR&reg; Research Team is owned &amp; operated by two able Canadians, Darren Rennick, &amp; Rick Graham, whom Bill &amp; Nadine regard very highly for their competence. Alongside this great side tour are a dozen other exciting options, from river rafting to a "Chasm Canyon" tour, &amp; from volcano hikes to natural hot springs.  There's vastly more to Costa Rica than dive resorts.  These are the <b>BEST ECO-TOURS in COSTA RICA</b>...</P>

<BR><FONT >Dear Diving Friends:</FONT><BR>



<P><FONT >Based on years of overseas property visits, photo



shoots, scuba diving trips &amp; staff interviews, this dive resort directory below is an



&quot;A List&quot; of the best &amp; brightest dive vacation destinations in



the U.S. Dive Travel system. This is only a fraction of the about 200+ beach resorts &amp; scuba diving operations 

we represent worldwide in 30 countries, because limited website space demands that we present only the 
popular or distinctive dive properties each season.  Some of these tropical vacation resorts &amp; hotels belong to large chains 

of vacation properties, &amp; we can offer you scores of these "sister resorts" any season, depending on 

availability &amp; size of team.  Because dive resort staffs, properties, prices &amp; programs



never stand still in the dynamic world of dive travel, this &quot;A List&quot;



will be updated periodically to reflect new service offerings &amp; new



dive vacation specials that we believe will give you exceptional benefits in



economy &amp; service. Thank you very much, adventure friends, for dropping by the dive resort index on our website. Hope you're



having a fun time planning your next dive trip.  Isn't that half the joy?</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT NOTE about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P>
</B></FONT><P>All package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging &amp; side tour prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge for one decade now. We normally secure excellent discount air tickets. Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals. </P>
<P>Unless specifically noted, these above scuba diving resort packages reflect prices for only the land-based portion of your dive vacation, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At many hotels there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International &amp; commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are assessed for air tickets &amp; the lodging + diving components. The baseline tariffs for all dive vacation clients are $55 per person for the land portion + $45 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients at dive resorts may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving. Solo clients will sometimes pay a single supplement to secure a private room on a dive package normally priced for double-occupancy.</P>
<P>The preferred payment mode for all lodging, scuba diving &amp; side tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations only via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for any reservations, please. Thank you for your gracious understanding, as our service level is concientious &amp; our prices for these dive resorts are low.  For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard.</P>
<P>Remember, all clients to all foreign destinations will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $35 - $45 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; &amp; away you go. Best of luck with your diving resorts. We hope your dive vacations are all safe &amp; satisfying adventures. Blessings &amp; best wishes in your quest for the perfect dive resorts.</P>


<P>Best wishes!</P>
