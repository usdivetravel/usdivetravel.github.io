<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">5.</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Here

are the rules by which your commissions are paid:</FONT></B><BR>

</P>



<UL>

<LI>Clients may pay your agency &amp; then you relay a wire transfer or 

cashier's check to USDT. Or you may ask clients to pay USDT directly.

(Please see the document titled U.S. Dive Travel's Terms &amp; Conditions

listed under <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">&quot;How to Book a Trip&quot;</FONT></B>

-- which you can click into from our Web site's Home Page.)<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>If your agency receives the client payment first &amp; then relays

it to USDT, you may deduct your commission up front, then send us the net

balance due per USDT invoice.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>If clients choose to pay USDT directly, &amp; when we are working on a schedule whereby clients first pay deposit more than 90 days out, then final balance more than 70 days out; or if clients decide to pay the full balance at once

-- in all such cases USDT will mail your commission check out no later than 7 working days after our receipt of final payment. This timeline holds whether

your agency or the client pays USDT.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Clients may pay USDT directly in three ways: via cashier's check; Mastercard

or Visa; or direct wire transfer.   Please note that USDT will not accept personal checks from 

any clients at any time.  Nor do we accept any form of a non-certified check from any agency -- 
only bank drafts are accepted, or wire transfers.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>All clients remitting with credit cards will pay USDT's regular rack

rate for land bookings -- with no cash discounts. However, all clients who pay

USDT directly via cashier's check will get a special 5% cash discount.

This cash discount price is the one already reflected in our website prices & also our standard 
e-mailed price sheets for all our land &amp; vessel packages. These standard advertising

sheets are e-mailed to all clients.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>We are extremely diligent about paying our commissions on time. We

know if we are reliable on our end of the agreement, we can count on your

continued loyalty as well, with plenty more future dive package bookings.</LI>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">6. If you are an IATA-certified travel center, 
or a bona fide outside agent leasing an agency's IATA number, 

once your credentials are established, then U.S. Dive Travel will pay the industry standard

travel-agent commissions for all lodging, diving, vessel trips &amp; side

tours</FONT></B> that you refer to us. (Please call us for details.) If your agency

is a regular contributor of referrals, we have a generous sliding scale

of commission over-rides (bonus points above the industry standard) that

depend on USDT's contract relationship with the resort or vessel booked;

&amp; also on your agency's annual volume. This bonus system rewards our

best agents for frequent referrals.</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">You also can earn</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">an

excellent over-ride for first-time booking of a group larger than 12 clients,

each of whom books at least five nights lodging + at least three days of

diving or side tours + add-on air tickets </FONT></B>for your host country

(or Hawaii).</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">7.</FONT></B> If USDT books <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">retail

air tickets</FONT></B> for your clients, this service is normally not commissionable.

Only land bookings are commissionable if all USDT requirements are met.

However, there's very good news for you about our wholesale air tickets....</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">8.</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#0000A0">If your agency

books wholesale air through the bulk-fare contract our partnership holds

with Continental </FONT></B>-- for international flights from most major

cities in the Lower 48 states to Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, Guatemala,

Panama or Nicaragua -- we will sell you air space at low net rates, sometimes

up to $70 - $200 per ticket below the lowest discount retail price available.</P>



<P>Then your agency can mark these air tickets up to clients as you see

fit, observing our prime requirement -- that markups <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">never

exceed the lowest retail price available </FONT></B>for that airline, that

destination &amp; those specific travel dates on the day the client commits.

We ask our affiliate agencies to exercise good judgment so these bookings

reflect well on our shared reputations for integrity &amp; customer service.

To better see how our wholesale air tickets work, please click back to

the website's Home Page, then click the hot-link for <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">&quot;Want

to be a Guide?&quot; </FONT></B>&amp; navigate to Index letter 'B.' </P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">9. </FONT></B>In cases when agents refer customized

land bookings to USDT (for example, packages for which <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">USDT

does NOT hold a wholesale contract </FONT></B>with a given hotel, resort,

vessel, dive operation or tour company) then USDT will pay your dive travel commissions

as follows: <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">50% (fifty percent) of the full land

commission</FONT></B> we receive, minus a small administrative service

fee (see Terms &amp; Conditions under &quot;How to Book a Trip&quot; on

the Web site's front page, for scale of service fees on F.I.T. bookings).

We also pay this same rate on overseas add-on air bookings, whenever USDT

earns a commission.</P>
