<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+3>RECOMMENDED GEAR LIST </FONT></FONT></B></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">To ensure your maximum safety overseas, U.S.

Dive Travel recommends that all scuba diving clients bring their own dive gear -- except

tanks &amp;amp; weights. of course.   All reputable dive shops worldwide will provide you with reliable tanks, weights & weight belts as part of their daily dive package.  When scuba diving in foreign locations, it is much safer

to use diving gear that is comfortable, in excellent repair & completely familiar

to you. We recommend you never rent diving gear overseas, especially regs & BCs.  The potential safety hazards you face may outweigh the 
minimal convenience factor.  Scuba diving is a gear-intensive sport & we recommend no diver, however experienced, 
take the repair status of his or her regulator & BC for granted.</FONT></B></P>



<P>1. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">MASK, FINS  & SNORKLE: </FONT></B>For

all clients who have prescription lenses mounted inside their masks, we

strongly recommend that you bring a spare mask. Losing or breaking your

mask might end your diving vacation. This is extremely easy to prevent.</P>



<P>2. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">BUOYANCY COMPENSATOR VEST</FONT></B>: Since

we place a high priority on reef preservation, we ask that you bring a

B.C. that you've used on at least 5 previous dives, so you're familiar

with it &amp;amp; you can maintain good buoyancy control near sensitive corals. 

Remember, one stray fin kick can destroy a century of coral growth.</P>



<P>3. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">REGULATOR & OCTOPUS: </FONT></B>This

is the one gear item most essential to your safety. Please ask your local dive

shop technician to give the first & second stages a complete check.

Overhaul all worn-out or damaged components before the dive trip. If high-pressure

& low-pressure hoses show any major wear, replace them -- this is crucial.

Again, be sure to complete at least 5 dives with your regulator & octopus,

to ensure your complete familiarity with its fit & operation in all

conditions, including deep water & brisk currents.</P>



<P>4. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">DEPTH GAUGE, TANK-PRESSURE GAUGE, UNDERWATER

TIMER & COMPASS: </FONT></B>At many dive destinations, your divemasters

will be working strictly by conservative no-decompression tables, to ensure

the highest standard of safety for all clients. However, because new dive

computers are extremely accurate, you may use one in place of a traditional

submersible console. If you haven't had your console instruments or computer

checked within the last year, please have your dive shop technician make

a thorough safety inspection before the dive tour. We also ask that you

log at least 5 dives with these instruments before the tour, so you're

fully attuned to all of their functions.</P>



<P>5. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">WETSUIT: </FONT></B>For all moderate tropical

climates such as Hawaii, Mexico, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean & 

the South Pacific, bring a full-length medium-weight wetsuit, preferably

the back-zipped jumpsuit style. Ocean temperatures in these regions seldom

vary from a range of 75-85 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, most clients

will feel more comfortable, will be protected from cuts or scrapes, &amp;amp;

will enjoy longer bottom times, when they wear an exposure suit of  about 3 mm in thickness. 

Hoods are not necessary in the tropics. Neoprene gloves & boots with strong semi-rigid soles are recommended for protection

against accidental brushes with coral, urchins or other spiny marine organisms.</P>



<P>6. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">UNDERWATER LIGHT  & BACKUP LIGHT: </FONT></B>Essential

gear for night diving. Both lights must be completely waterproof down to

130 feet. Inspect the O-rings &  replace them if worn. Bring new batteries

-- plus a set of spare batteries & bulbs -- for each lantern. A standard

"gun-grip" light with a weight-belt lanyard is an excellent choice.

The backup need only be a small flashlight-style unit that clips to the

weight belt.</P>



<P>7. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">DIVING KNIFE: </FONT></B>Bring a small-bladed

rustproof stainless-steel sheath knife, with both regular & serrated

edges, a flat prying point & a curved inset for slicing nylon lines.

The knife -- which is a tool & not a weapon -- should strap to the

mid-calf.</P>



<P>8. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">DIVE LOGBOOK: </FONT></B>Self-explanatory.

You might want to bring an underwater slate, too. </P>



<P>9. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">THE TROPICAL TEN ESSENTIALS:
</FONT></B>Passport;

driver's license; money belt; security pouch; traveler's checks in Polynesia

(you get much better exchange rates!), but cash ($5 to $50 bills) works

best in the Caribbean & the Americas; dark sunglasses with neck cord;

wide-brimmed sunhat; lots of #29-40 waterproof sunscreen; insect repellent;

iodine-based water purification tablets (Potable Aqua is excellent, if

you're not allergic). </P>



<P>10. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">FIRST-AID  & HEALTH KIT: </FONT></B>Bring

a plastic bottle of hydrogen peroxide & a box of Q-tips to disinfect

even minor cuts & scrapes in the tropics, since staph infections are

common. Also bring ointments for athletes foot & jock itch, & anti-fungal

powder. Consider a prescription for an extended course of antibiotics to

combat staph infections (use only if you contract a major infection, NOT

as a preventative!). Your kit also should include band-aids, antibiotic

cream, several sterile gauze bandages, an ace bandage, tweezers, small

scissors, thermometer, sterile cotton balls, a good water filter such as

a Katadyne, multi-vitamin pills, over-the-counter pain reliever such as

acetominephan or ibuprofin, anti-diarrhea medicine & jellyfish sting

lotion. Before using any medicines, prescription or not, we ask that you please 

consult your doctor about any possible health effects that you, because

of your unique biochemistry, may experience while scuba diving.</P>



<P>11. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">OCTOPUS KEEPER: </FONT></B>This small plastic

clip attaches your backup second-stage to the middle of your B.C., & 

prevents it from dragging across the bottom or snagging on reefs.</P>



<P>12. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">TWO MEDIUM-SIZED PADLOCKS: </FONT></B>For

your dive bag in transit, & for a hotel or guest-house storeroom overseas.

Carry one set of keys on your ring. Bring one spare set.</P>



<P>13. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">TRAVEL SUNDRIES: </FONT></B>Don't forget

small but essential items such as toothpaste & toothbrush, film, a

few books for killing time, deodorant, chapstick, shampoo, cotton underwear,

swimsuit, shorts, T-shirts, writing tablets, gum, dry snacks, shaving cream

& disposable razors. These little items can be very expensive overseas.

Pack everything to survive rough baggage handling. In the South Pacific,

small gifts such as Tupperware, pens, gum, candy & tinned meats are

appreciated & relished by native islanders.</P>
