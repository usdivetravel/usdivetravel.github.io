Keep in touch with John & Susie as the Yap discount scene is an exciting "moveable feast"!

Also, guests receive a complimentary one class up-grade in rooms (subject to availability) and, on top of that, a restaurant voucher worth US$25 if the reservation is booked and deposited between now and the end of the DEMA show.  When Bill activates it, this offer is valid for travel, stay and departure between April 15th and December 14th. When booking you must ask for the "Group Special" by name. Seven-night, ten-dive packages start at approx $1300 - $1400 p.p. and include room, tax, diving, airport transfers and a daily breakfast package. The free spaces apply to double occupancy rooms only.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Dear Partner, Good morning !</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">As promised, here is an update as to what is
happening, construction-wise, here at the Manta Ray Bay Hotel &amp; Yap
Divers. We have built walls, and decorated them, closing off all of the
constructions sites to our guests. All walkways are now paved and only
awaiting the final paving stones, which are due to arrive in Yap tomorrow
via ship from Indonesia. You can also see that the swimming pool is now
very close to being ready to fill. You can even see the manta rays taking
shape on the bottom of the pool! Please advise your clients that we are
expanding. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We are relocating &quot;Mnuw&quot;(the permanently
moored wooden ship), adding a new dive base, a swimming pool, 7 new rooms,
a staff apartment, a public toilet, a staff locker room, a new laundry
facility, a new compressor room and compressor plus a NITROX membrane system,
a new lobby and new offices. As of today, March 15th, Mnuw is in her new
position and is fully open to the public, the dive base is complete, the
swimming pool is within a week of opening, 6 of the new rooms will open
about the 1st of April, the staff apartment will be completed on the 1st
of April, the public toilet will be complete by the 1st of April, as will
the new NITROX system. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Next up is to pave the walkways with stones,
install the gazebos over the new plunge pools for rooms 106 and 107, install
the new dive shop briefing gazebos (all of these 5 gazebos are being built
in Bali and will come here ready to erect) and then begin work on the new
lobby building. The entire project should be complete by the 1st of November,
barring any unforeseen delays in obtaining materials from off-island.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We hired the head grounds keeper away from
the Bali Grand Hyatt in Sanur (Indonesia) and he is already working his
magic with the plants around the hotel and in the rooms. We expect the
completed project to be an oasis this time next year. If you have any questions,
please don't hesitate to contact me and thank you very much for your continued
support. Your business is sincerely appreciated by all of us here at the

mating rituals of Yap's ever-lovin' manta rays:</FONT></B></P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"></FONT></B>
<P>


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We have been having a lot of fun here in Yap
lately ! The mantas have been their usual promiscuous selves here in the
month of February. There have been a lot of sightings -- large groups
of mantas following each other -- playing in the current at the Ridge,
and of course participating in the absolutely magical act of the mating
dance. There is nothing quite like watching a group of 15-20 individuals
barrel rolling, loopty-doing, and of course mating in front of your eyes.
Absolutely one of the finest sights to behold underwater.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Another show stopper these past couple of weeks
has been the southern wall dives of Lionfish Wall, Gilman's Wall, Yap Caverns,
and all of the areas to the south. Everyone has been returning from these
dives raving about the unlimited visibility, the magnificent colors, and
the large variety of fish life to be found all over the southern end of
the reef. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Our favorite macro site, conveniently named
&quot;Macro,&quot; has been a stellar arena of discovery the past few weeks.
Nudibranchs of all shapes and colors have been found in singles and pairs,
crocodile fish, a large and cooperative resident Mantis Shrimp, the mini-city
of anemone fish, and of course pipefish galore have all pleased our guests
immensely. Perhaps the most entertaining feature of this sight is the cleaner
shrimp who will happily clean finger cuticles and of course jump excitedly
into the mouth of anyone brave enough to offer themselves up for a little
dental checkup.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Our resident Mandarin Fish population has not
stopped its promiscuous ways either. In fact, we had a guest mention she
had never before had the chance to capture photos of the mating behavior.
Well, this was fixed real quick after an evening visit to Rainbow Reef.
She found at least 10 different pairs mating! This is truly one of the
finest photo ops in the underwater world and not a dive to be missed.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We have also visited the wreck of the Laura
Marie on several occasions to capture the stunning Longnose Hawkfish which
live on brilliant red sponges as opposed to their typical black coral or
sea fans. Another great photo opp to be sure.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">On a completely different front, the concrete
floor has been poured for the future Manta Pool located beside the Mnuw
Restaurant and Bar. This will soon be a fantastic addition to the Manta
Ray Bay Hotel. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We would like to thank all of our guests from
the last couple of weeks, once again a very international crowd. Two large
groups have been with us for the last week: Mass Diving from New England
and The Dive Shop from Fairfax, Virginia. We have also had guests from
all parts of the US as well as the UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Japan,
Hong Kong, and all points in between.</FONT></B></P>

<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>ABOUT BILL ACKER, the WELL-LOVED FOUNDER of MANTA RAY BAY HOTEL:<BR>
</B></B></B></FONT>Bill Acker, founder of the Manta Ray Bay Hotel and Yap Divers is proud to share his love of Yap and diving with quests from all over the world. A resident of Yap for almost 30 years, Bill is eminently qualified to make your Micronesian dive experience one that you'll never forget.  Bill first came to Yap as a Peace Corps Volunteer in 1976. Bill Acker originally hails from Austin, Texas and after graduating from High School in Garland, he attended the University of Texas where he graduated with a degree in marketing.  Bill is constantly asked "What brought you to Yap?" and invariably answers with tales of reading Mitchner, Conrad and Kipling plus watching anything produced about the South Pacific. The lure of the tropics has been in Billï¿½s blood since his early childhood days.</P>
<P>After two years in the Peace Corps, Bill Acker studied at the University of Hawaii Graduate School of Business and was there two years when a call for assistance came from old friends and "family" in Yap. Bill left Honolulu and became the manager of the WAAB Transportation Company where he stayed for the next 13 years. As part of his accomplishments while directing WAAB Transportation, Bill took up the sport of scuba diving.  One thing led to another and one of the results of this new hobby became known as Yap Divers. Bill conceived the idea of opening Yapï¿½s first dive shop in the fall of 1985 and by the Summer of 1986, Yap Diverï¿½s was affiliated with both NAUI and PADI and opened for business. As they say, "The rest is history".</P>
<P>With guidance from the late Paul Tzimoulis, Hall of Fame dive pioneer and publisher of SKIN DIVER MAGAZINE, Bill developed the manta dives and the publicity that has culminated in Yap being one of the top international dive destinations in the world. With very few exceptions, all of the dive sites in Yap were found, explored and named by Bill.  With over 9,000 dives in the waters of Yap, Bill is a member of the original class of SSI Platinum Pro Divers. As a PADI instructor, Bill remains active in exploring new dive sites and teaching the sport to people interested in sharing his love for the ocean environment.</P>
<P>Along the way, Bill met and married Patricia Mangthin of Yap and they have 4 wonderful children (Numie, Nathan, Valerie and Opie). All of the family are active in the sport of diving and share in their fatherï¿½s commitment to safety and preservation of this natural resource.  Bill and his family own and operate the Manta Ray Bay Hotel & Yap Divers. He can be found at the hotel 7 days a week, ready to help with suggestions on diving, photography, fishing or just relaxing on the back deck. As a family owned and operated dive resort, you can be sure that your satisfaction is taken very seriously and that the "boss" is around to help you in the event assistance is required.</P>

<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>THE FAMOUS MANTA RAYS of YAP ISLAND:<BR>
</FONT></B>
Yap is world famous for it's large population of resident manta rays. On Yap island a manta dive does not mean you submerge just hoping for a manta encounter, it means diving to see the mantas - any day, any time, it's a given.  Manta Ray Bay Hotel has made Yap famous for it's large population of resident Manta Rays. Yap is probably the best place on earth to see these gentle giants, &amp; Yap Divers is expert at showing them to you. Over 100 Manta Rays live year round in the waters surrounding Yap. In the winter (usually December to late April) the Mantas congregate in even greater numbers in Mi'l Channel for the mating season. During the summer season, they spend their mornings in Goofnuw channel in the Valley of the Rays, one epicenter of Yap dive vacations.   There are few dive resorts like Manta Ray Bay Hotel anywhere in the world, where large fish like this are so plentiful & used to divers. Never a dull day with Yap diving, all ye funseekers!</P>
<P>Every morning on your Yap diving vacation, huge Manta Rays cruise into protected channels that penetrate the barrier reef. They come to "Cleaning Stations" where small specialized reef fishes called cleaners pick off tiny parasites that the Mantas pick up in blue water while feeding. The Mantas slowly circle the cleaning station &amp; frequently pass within inches of the observing diver's heads. Small Mantas are generally about 8 feet from wingtip to wingtip. The largest rays are up to 14 feet across. </P>
<P>During the Manta mating season (December to late April), processions of as many as a dozen of the huge Rays can be seen cruising back &amp; forth in Mi'l Channel. Yap Divers has identified several Manta cleaning stations, &amp; guides are expert at finding the Mantas.  These savvy guides make Yap dive vacations an adventure to remember.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>MORE YAP DIVING HIGHLIGHTS:<BR>
</B></FONT></B>
There's much more to a Yap diving vacation than just manta rays, however. Yap's outer reefs abound with many multi-colored species of tropical reef fishes, invertebrates &amp; corals. When coupled with the abundance of larger species like mantas, sharks, &amp; turtles, Yap is a paradise for the underwater photographer or videographer. More than 200 species of hard &amp; soft corals form the reefs of Yap. </P>
<P>A dive site called Yap Caverns, at the southern tip of the island, offers a truly spectacular dive with an array of caverns, swim-throughs &amp; pinnacles populated by Lionfish &amp; sleeping whitetip reef sharks. Large schools of Huge Bumphead Parrotfish are often seen here. A unique feature of Yap Caverns is that the dive is not restricted to advanced divers, & beginners have no trouble negotiating the swim throughs.  Therefore novices are able to share an experience of rare beauty otherwise reserved for more experienced divers. </P>
<P>The reefs on the east side of the island (windward side) feature gently sloping terraces with one of the most diverse selections of hard corals in Micronesia.  The west side of the island (lee side) is composed of a series of vertical walls starting in 15 feet of water &amp; plunging straight down hundreds of feet. The visibility on the reefs usually exceeds 100 feet &amp; frequently is over 150 ft.  Yap diving, is often  blessed with this extra-terrestrial viz, experts confirm.</P>
<P>Many species of marine creatures that are rare in some parts of the world are plentiful in Yap island. Dive sites such as Lionfish Wall offer a chance to experience the beauty of a pristine coral reef. One perpetual favorite of divers is the colorful clownfish. Five species can be seen in Yap on most scuba diving tours. Some of the anemones they live in are over four feet across &amp; host dozens of clowns at one time.  Who says Yap dive vacations are all manta rays?  The critters abound down here.  So send in the clowns!</B><BR>

NITROX, MACRO DIVES &amp; MANTA <BR>
SPECIALTY SCUBA DIVING COURSE:<BR>
</B></FONT>Yap Divers offers a course to certify you as a Nitrox diver. The dive shop offers 32% enriched air for your safety &amp; diving pleasure. If you are already certified as a Nitrox diver &amp; wish to use Nitrox on any, or all of your dives with us, please notify the dive staff &amp; we will be happy to assist you.</P>
<P>Another new feature this year is the Macro Dive. A special dive site has been discovered in the main channel that offers more invertebrate life per square meter than any known site in Micronesia. The nudibranchs are outstanding &amp; the diving guides have become very good at finding &amp; identifying the animals for you. This is a great place for macro-photography enthusiasts as well as for people who want to experience something very different from normal daily dives in Micronesia.  Yap diving will hone your photo skills, as these awesome creatures move slowly enough to catch on film easily.</P>
<P>Bill Acker, general manager of Manta Ray Bay Hotel &amp; a member of the original class of SSI Platinum Pro Divers, teaches a PADI Specialty Course entitled "Manta Ray Awareness". This course involves a short video, a short lecture/discussion with Bill &amp; 2 Manta dives. You will learn about the habitats of the Yapese mantas, about the cleaning stations &amp; fish that inhabit the stations, become proficient in telling males from females as well as identifying the individual rays by name. This course is a must for anyone wishing to know more about watching, photographing &amp; enjoying the gentle Manta Rays of Yap island. Any of the scuba diving staff or front desk workers can make the arrangements for you to take this class.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>BEAUTIFUL CLIMATE on YAP:<BR>
</B></FONT>The climate in Yap is big time tropical -- hot & humid. Average year-round temperature is 81ï¿½ F (27ï¿½ C), with a 10ï¿½ F (6ï¿½ C) variation between night &amp; day. The average water temperature is 82ï¿½ F (28ï¿½ C). Annual rainfall is 121 inches (3090 mm). Northeast tradewinds blow from November to May, resulting in less rain &amp; lower humidity during these months. Typhoons are uncommon. The ones hitting other areas of the western Pacific during the typhoon season usually pass to the north of Yap Island Proper. </P>



<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>LUXURY FEATURES of the MANTA RAY BAY HOTEL:<BR>

</B></FONT>The Manta Ray Bay Hotel is a dedicated dive resort, designed by divers &amp; built for divers. Its 28 beautifully refurbished rooms offer air conditioning, satellite TV, in-room fridges, &amp; VCR's. The hotel was built with scuba divers in mind. All of the dive facilities &amp; equipment storage are conveniently located within steps of the Hotel. Yap Divers, located on the premises, offers a full service dive shop, all levels of instruction, Mares equipment rental, morning &amp; afternoon two tank dives to either the Manta sites or the reefs, &amp; night dives on request. </P>

<P>Along with these classic Yap diving vacation packages, we also offer world class fishing with Yap Anglers, &amp; an opportunity to explore the wildlife &amp; nature by kayaking with Yap's Planet Blue Kayak Tours. The third floor of the hotel houses the Manta Ray Grill, the Island's finest restaurant with a great view of the lagoon. Our Yap diving guests can also enjoy a refreshing tropical drink in the Nautical Weaver Bar on the ground floor right at the edge of the sea. </P>

<P>The visual theme of the entire redecorated hotel is "vivid marine life."  Each distinctly designed room bears a fish name, and is decorated accordingly, with photographs & paintings of that fish, right down to the hand carved key chains and handmade bedspreads. The double doors connecting the rooms of the suite are adorned with carvings of manta rays.  The hotel has been expanded to 28 rooms, including 15 Ocean View, 4 Deluxe Ocean View and 9 Standard. The Ocean View rooms are located on the seaward side of the hotel, providing a nice view of the lagoon from their private balconies. The Standard rooms are located on the opposite side, overlooking the road and the hills beyond.</P>
<P>One of the Deluxe Ocean View rooms is located on the 3rd floor and has a private spiral staircase leading to an exclusive roof top Jacuzzi and sun deck. We can offer a suite by opening adjoining doors in the Deluxe Ocean View Room. The suite includes two full bathrooms, one king size bed and two queen size beds, two balconies and two TV/VCRs. Two other Deluxe Ocean View Rooms are located on the ground floor, each having a huge private deck extending over the lagoon with a private plunge pool. There is an antique king-size bed in each of these rooms. Our newest Deluxe Ocean View Room is on the 3rd floor and is a mini-suite with a king-sized bed, tropical hardwood flooring in the bedroom portion, a sitting area and a unique indoor garden shower.</P>
<P>The first floor has 5 rooms with a queen size waterbed and a queen size regular bed per room. Most of the rooms on the second and third floors have two queen size regular beds per room. A few rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors have 1 king size bed per room. The Deluxe Ocean View Rooms have one king size antique bed.  All rooms are air-conditioned and have ceiling fan, color TV/VCR, international direct dial telephone, refrigerator (upon request), private bathroom with hot water and built-in hair dryer, as well as a private balcony with the Ocean View and Deluxe Ocean View Rooms. Most rooms have built-in electronic safes and for those rooms that do not have these feature, a bank of individual safes is located at the Front Desk. In addition, we have installed a sophisticated and highly efficient water purification and treatment system, resulting in fully potable in-room tap water. Our 20,000 gallon storage tank means that the Manta Ray Bay always has 24 hour water, which is a unique bonus in the dry season on an island.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>YAP ISLAND's ANCIENT CULTURE & TRADITIONS:<BR>
</B></FONT>There's even more color on Yap than the kind you find scuba diving.  The Yapese have managed to maintain their ancient culture better than anywhere else in Micronesia. The heritage &amp; traditions of the Yapese people are carefully nourished to preserve the Micronesian way of life. Yapese culture centers around the village. Most Yapese still live in villages as their ancestors have for millennia. The contrast between old &amp; new is sometimes staggering to the casual visitor, as well educated Yapese, fluent in English &amp; with access to modern schooling &amp; health care, still prefer to lead their lives in the old fashioned way.  There is something to be said about a calm &amp; peaceful way of life, with no urban stress. We wonder if North Americans remember the good old days any more.</P>
<P>Village life is influenced by a caste system which is complex &amp; full of subtle nuances a visitor can never hope to fully understand. Status &amp; success in Yapese society can be gained in a variety of ways, but the acquisition of material wealth in the western fashion is not one of them. Kindness & a generous spirit are prized in this culture.  A shy, but gentle &amp; friendly people, the Yapese welcome visitors from abroad. On our cultural tours, you will have the opportunity to visit a village &amp; experience bona fide rural village life &amp; traditions for yourself.  We feel this is as vital a part of any Yap diving vacation as the manta rays.</P>
<P>The Yapese have a strong tradition of chants &amp; dances, often of ancient origin. The chants &amp; dances always tell a story, &amp; teaching them to each new generation is an important part of preserving the Yapese heritage. Magic &amp; ritual has a strong influence in Yapese society. "The magic is strong in Yap" is a commonly held opinion throughout most of the western Pacific, where the Yapese are held in great esteem as great navigators. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>The RENOWNED STONE WHEEL CURRENCY of YAP:<BR>
</B></FONT></B>Yap is probably best known among non-divers as the Land of Stone Money. Up to 12 feet in diameter these massive stone discs rate without competition as the largest coins in the world. The US dollar is the common currency in Yap, but the stone money is still used to this day for major transactions like payment of dowry or purchase of land. Anyway, wonder how much Fred Flintstone would have paid for Wilma...</P>
<P>One of the amazing facts about this stone money, or "Rai" as the wheels are called in Yapese, is that these gigantic stone discs were not quarried on the island. Instead, the Yapese traveled by outrigger canoe more than 300 miles to the neighboring island nation of Palau. There, in a quarry on northern Babelthaob, the Rai were hewn out of the rock with primitive tools &amp; brought back to Yap on a perilous journey in the canoes.  The value of an individual Rai piece is not determined by its size alone. Its shape, the quality &amp; texture of the stone &amp; most important: the difficulty of acquisition is equally important in assessing value. The greater the effort involved in bringing it safely home, the storms encountered &amp; all too often, the men lost in the process - contribute to increase the value. </P>
<P>The Rai are not carried about, for obvious reasons. Individual pieces are found all over Yap, but most are kept in "Stone Money Banks" in the villages. When Rai shift hands as the result of a business transaction, a wedding or otherwise, the news spreads fast &amp; it is soon common knowledge that a particular piece has a new owner. The Rai are seldom moved at all, but remain where they stand.  Oh, as much as we would love to meld this concept with your Yap diving vacation, one cannot tip the divemasters in 200 lb Rai(just pulling your fins! ;)</P>
<P>In the mid 19th century the Irish-American trader &amp; adventurer David Dean O'Keefe started a successful business using his ship to carry stone money from the Palau quarries to Yap in exchange for copra &amp; beche-de-mer. The Yapese liked the idea, &amp; even if the "O'Keefe-money" was valued much lower than the Rai brought by canoe, they offered a welcome possibility for the less well-off to own money &amp; thus increase their status in the village. O'Keefe was well loved by the Yapese people who refused to trade with anyone else, &amp; he maintained his monopoly for over 30 years.</P><BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>WHERE in HEAVEN's NAME is YAP, ANYWAY?<BR>
</B></FONT>Manta Ray Bay Hotel &amp; Yap Divers are on the history-laden island of Yap in the Western Caroline Island chain. Yap is located approximately 10 degrees North of the equator, between Palau &amp; Guam &amp; the Philippines. Cooled by gentle trade winds, Yap's year-round temperatures average in the mid 80 degrees F (26C) &amp; it offers average ocean temperatures of 81 degrees F (27C).</P>
<P>While the mantas are the prime attraction that puts Yap on the map for scuba divers, the pristine reefs &amp; walls are the icing on the cake. There are more than 90 miles of coral reefs &amp; walls to tempt you. While the popular reefs at some of Yap's neighboring Micronesian islands see as many as 100 divers per day, many of Yap's beautiful reefs see fewer divers than that in one entire year. The Yap reefs are home to more than 150 species of corals &amp; more than 750 species of vibrantly colored tropical fish.</P>
<P>Yapese traditions are still taught to all children. The islanders are determined to ensure that their culture does not succumb to westernization. While the island has modern facilities, many Yapese still live an idyllic traditional lifestyle.  Every village has a men's house constructed of large logs, bamboo &amp; thatch. The men meet in the evening to tell stories &amp; educate the village boys in the arts of fishing, sailing &amp; crafts. Men from other villages who have strayed too far to reach home before dark can spend a night in another village's men's house.</P>
<P>The dances of Yap tell stories &amp; relate the history of the island. By learning the dances, children learn about the ancient heritage of their people. Dances are performed every week, &amp; the Manta Ray Bay Hotel can arrange a tour for you to witness them &amp; see a bit of the village life.  This is a splendid "spice of life" way to enliven your Yap diving vacation.</P>

<P>The traveler on any Yap diving vacation is offered all that he or she could ever ask for in terms of dive experiences with regularly scheduled drift dives, wall dives, cavern dives &amp; night dives, as well as the Yap specialty -- giant manta dives. Although there is a host of charted dive sites &amp; a program to discover more dive destinations, the fun part is that more than 80% of Yap's reefs remain unexplored. </P>
<P>Very few divers now know -- or ever will know in future years -- the joys of Yap diving locales like the certified dive staff at Yap Divers. Mi'l Channel, one of the classic dive destinations, is more than the "home of the mantas". This site offers teeming underwater life &amp; color everywhere. Yap Divers' boats are modern, radio equipped dive boats, ranging in size from 21-38 feet, which allows the staff to accommodate your individual .

Yap Anglers is a new division of the Yap resort. For a number of years, there is been asked by several of the Yap guests to offer optional fishing charters. We also hosted a popular Hawaiian television series, Let's Go Fishing, a number of times. This coupled with the growing requests , prompted us to offer the Yap guests the chance to go fishing with us, &amp; the prime specialty is giant trevally off the reefs of Yap. Using 20 lb. test lines, these huge muscular fish offer a good fight &amp; provide for an exciting day.  This is a refreshing add-on to any dive vacations.  Check it out.</P>
<P>Yap Anglers is dedicated to "catch &amp; release" fishing only, thus saving this resource for the future guests. We do, however, allow one fish to be brought aboard &amp; prepared in the restaurant for dinner.</P>

</B></FONT></B></B>
Our North American clients take Continental Airlines via LAX, through Honolulu &amp; Guam to Yap island. This is a well-established route. Our European clients usually fly direct from any of the major hubs on the European continent to Manila, Philippines. Then they board a Continental Micronesia flight which takes them to Yap. For our clients in North &amp; South America, the Caribbean, &amp; Australia, the route is usually via Guam first then Yap, also on Continental Micronesia. </P>
<P>Currently there are 2 flights per week between Palau &amp; Yap &amp; 2 flights per week between Guam &amp; Yap. All flights departing Yap to Guam connect directly with flights to Truk Lagoon or to the US Mainland.   Once you pass customs at the airport, we'll be there to take you to Manta Ray Bay Hotel. <I>Ta boch gad!</I> (See you soon!)</B></P>

<FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT NOTE about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:<BR>
</B></FONT>The Yap diving vacation experience makes a perfectly fun finale for dive tours booked with the Sun Dancer II in Palau, or the Truk Aggressor, or Palau Aggressor, all cruising in relatively nearby Micronesian isles.  All Yap diving package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Land prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge for one decade now. We normally secure excellent discount air tickets. Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals, on these Yap diving vacation packages. </P>
<P>Unless specifically noted, these above Yap diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of your vacation, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At most dive resorts &amp; on most live-aboard vessels, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International &amp; commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the lodging + diving components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $55 per person for the land portion + $45 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients at many dive resorts may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving. Solo Yap diving clients will always pay a single supplement at any dive resorts to secure a private room -- normally 35% to 50% more -- &amp; possibly a full doubling of the standard double-occupancy rate at some resorts, &amp; on most live-aboards.</P>
<P>The preferred payment mode for all lodging, Yap diving &amp; side tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for Yap diving vacations only via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any dive vacations, please. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level for these dive tours is the highest &amp; our prices the lowest in this industry, &amp; thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard.</P>
<P>Remember, all clients to all foreign destinations will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $35 - $45 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; &amp; away you go. Best of luck with your Yap diving vacation plans. We hope your scuba vacation is a safe &amp; satisfying adventure. Blessings &amp; best wishes for all your dive vacations -- scuba tours or snorkeling trips.</P>
<P>Best fishes too!</P>
