July 22, '05 -- Islamic terrorists triggered nearly-simultaneous bombings at the Red Sea resort city of Sharm el-Sheikh, killing at least 88 people & injuring an estimated 200 others.   Police reported the three explosions were two suicide car bombs & one planted bag bomb.   It was Egypt's deadliest bombing in several years.    The bombings happened on Egypt's National Day, which recalls the 1952 bloodless revolution that brought army officers to power after ousting King Farouk.   One suicide car bomb killed 17 Egyptian workers in a coffee shop at the city's Old Market, police said.   The other suicide car bomber struck the Ghazala Garden Hotel, streaking through a security checkpoint & slamming into the hotel's reception area before exploding.  The hotel lobby area collapsed, along with its roof.   The Old Market area was a vast mess of broken glass & litter.   The third bomb was an improvised device left in a bag; & it killed six tourists at a beachfront parking lot & shuttle stop about two miles from the hotel.   The explosions happened about 1:15 a.m. Egypt time, or 6:15 p.m. Friday EDT, but the hotels & the market were crowded anyway with tourists partying, or seeking relief from their hot hotel rooms.   The first car was packed with 660 pounds of explosives & slammed into the reception of the Ghazala Gardens in Sharm's Naama Bay, the main strip of hotels, police said. The second bomb weighed about 440 pounds & exploded in a nearby area called the Old Market, frequented mostly by Egyptians working in the town's resorts.  A third bomb, believed hidden in a sack, detonated near a beachside walkway where tourists often stroll at night.  Dr. Saeed Abdel Fattah, manager of the Sharm el-Sheik International Hospital, where the victims were taken, said those killed included two Britons, two Germans & an Italian, he added.  Czech officials said one Czech tourist was also killed.  There were conflicting claims of responsibility.  Several hours after the attacks, a group citing  ties to Al Qaeda issued a claim on an Islamic Web site.   The Abdullah Azzam Brigades, Al Qaeda, in Syria and Egypt, was one of two groups that also claimed responsibility for October bombings at the resorts of Taba and Ras Shitan that killed 34. This same terror group also claimed responsibility for a Cairo bombing in April.

Ten days of hellish uncertainty -- for victims & families alike -- ended today for 11 European tourists + eight Egyptians abducted in the Egyptian desert on Sept. 19, when government operatives swarmed over their captors, winning their freedom.  All 19 hostages were freed unharmed in a bold rescue operation in which several of their terrorist kidnappers were killed in a fierce struggle with authorities, Egyptian officials said.  The liberated hostages arrived in Cairo aboard an Egyptian military plane, some of them grinning, some holding bunches of flowers, to be greeted by Egyptian military and government officials and foreign diplomats.  These 19 hostages were freed in what Egyptian media called a "rescue and recovery operation," although officials gave only sparse details about how commandos secured the release or how the hostage-takers were killed.  Later conflicting news accounts stated some hostages hinted they were simply let go, without any firefight, just randomly by the terrorists who feared government troops closing in.  The hostages' 10-day ordeal had deeply embarrassed Egypt which depends on foreign tourism for 6 percent of its gross domestic product.  "They have all arrived safely. No ransom was paid from any of the hostage countries," Tourism Minister Zoheir Garrana assured international reporters. "We will coordinate with security agencies to make sure this doesn't happen again."  Masked gunmen seized the five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptians on Sept. 19 from a desert safari tour conducted near Egypt's southwestern borders with Sudan and Libya.  The kidnappers then rushed their captives southward into harsh desert terrain in Sudan and demanded a multi-million-dollar ransom.

A terrorist bomb killed a French teenager and wounded at least 20 other people in a crowded square near a popular tourist bazaar in the Egyptian capital Cairo on Feb. 22, 2009, officials said.   The blast was the first fatal attack on tourists in Egypt since bombs killed at least 23 people at an Egyptian resort in the Sinai Peninsula in 2006.   This latest deadly bomb -- aimed at foreign tourists -- exploded near the 14th-century Khan el-Khalili market in eastern Cairo, a souk where tourists shop for small gifts and relax at outdoor cafes.    A similar blast in the same area murdered three tourists in 2005.   The Health Ministry of Egypt said a 17-year-old French girl was killed and 13 French tourists, plus three Saudis and four Egyptians had been wounded. The German Foreign Ministry also reported one German national had been injured.  Egyptian state new agency MENA quoted security officials as reporting that one bomb had exploded under a bench in a garden in the square, and that a second bomb had been defused by security forces.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police sources confirmed two suspects had been taken into custody.   Reuters International reported this in Feb. 2009: "the bombing is embarrassing for the government, which has tried hard to project an image of security and stability, but angered public opinion at home and across the Arab world by helping Israel to enforce a blockade on the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, and failing to condemn its recent onslaught on the Palestinian territory more forcefully."

Starting about Jan. 25, 2011, street violence and rioting broke out all across Egypt, especially in Cairo, Luxor, Alexandria & other major cities, where protestors against military strongman Hosni Mubarak massed along the streets in the tens of thousands.  On Jan. 25, at least four people were killed at "Day of Wrath" anti-government protests across Egypt as demonstrators vented their rage, complaining of poverty, unemployment  and government repression.  Then on Jan. 27, security forces shot to death a Bedouin protester in the north of Egypt's Sinai region, bringing the death toll to five on the third day of protests.   Later, on Jan. 28, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas as protesters hurled stones at them and yelled  "Down, Down, Hosni Mubarak!"  Police blanketed Cairo and blocked social networking communications in an effort to strangle the protests.  Egyptian Internet servers were blocked across the country, throttling a key tool for reform-seeking political activists.  Hospital and government sources placed the death toll by Feb. 2 at more than 100, with thousands injured.  Cairo suffered widespread looting, fires, destroyed vehicles and days of total shutdown of airports and public transport.  Some independent foreign journalists placed the civilian death toll higher than 300 by Feb. 2, 2011.

<p>All 224 people on a Russian jetliner were killed today when an Airbus A321 crashed in Egypt's Sinai peninsula shortly after takeoff from the popular Egyptian Red Sea resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh, officials reported.  Shortly after the plane went down, the terror group ISIS took credit for planning & executing the crash.  The Metrojet flight, carrying 217 passengers and seven crew, was en route from Sharm to St. Petersburg, Russia when it plummeted off radar screens & crashed in a remote desert sector, only 23 minutes into the doomed flight.</p>

<p>This was the air accident with heaviest death toll in the history of Russian aviation, surpassing even a 1985 disaster in Uzbekistan in which 200 people died, the Russian-run news agency RIA reported.  "Unfortunately, all passengers of flight 7K9268 Sharm el-Sheikh-Petersburg were killed," The Russian embassy in Cairo said, in Russian, on Twitter. "We express our condolences to the family and friends."  Egyptian officials said the 7-person crew  and 214 of the passengers and all of the crew were Russian and that three of the passengers were Ukrainian, RT.com reported.  The victims included 17 children, aged 2 to 17, according to Russian authorities.</p>

<p>At least 16 people were killed and five more injured in an explosive Molotov Cocktail attack on a nightclub near Cairo, the Egyptian capital, according to the country's state-run news agency, MENA.  The attack, with hand-made fire-bombs, took place early Friday morning, MENA said. This club is in the Agouza neighborhood in Egypt's Giza governorate on the outskirts of Cairo, on the western bank of the Nile River.  That suburb is favored by a significant number of foreign nationals.  State-run Al-Ahram reported that masked assailants attacked the nightclub, and the Egyptian prosecutor and police are currently investigating.  Defying all credible logic, and widely dismissed by news pundits worldwide, Egypt's state-run Nile TV reported that authorities say the attackers' motive was criminal and not related to terrorism.</p>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#000000">April 11, 2017 - CNN, the New York Times and wire services reported that Egypt's government declared a 3-month state of emergency after two suicide bombings targeted Coptic Christian churches on Palm Sunday, killing at least 49 worshippers and bystanders.  The Islamist group ISIS claimed full responsibility for the bombings, which were aimed at a Christian religious minority on one of their most sacred  holy days of  the Christian calendar.  At least 27 people died in a blast inside a church in the northern city of Tanta, and 78 people were injured, according to Egypt's state-run news agency Al-Ahram. In Alexandria, 18 civilians and four police officers were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a Coptic church, Al-Ahram explained.  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared three days of nationwide mourning after  these terror bombings and said a three-month state of emergency would take effect  once constitutional measures are finished.  In response to these calculated terrorist attacks, the country will also form a supreme council to counter terrorism and extremism, Sisi said on national television April 9 after an emergency meeting of the country's National Defense Council.  </FONT></FONT></B></LI>
