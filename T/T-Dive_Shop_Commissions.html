<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">2.</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">USDT

will check air &amp; land space A.S.A.P.</FONT></B> for you. We'll e-mail you with preliminary facts that same day 
(with nearly all bookings).</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">3.</FONT></B> If the prices &amp; itinerary

meet with your travel teams' approval, please phone or e-mail us with your OK. 

Or you may turn the booking

details over to your clients directly.  When either your dive shop, or the

clients themselves, contact USDT with final trip instructions, this is

a formal booking &amp; you've earned your commission.  Commission amounts vary with size of 

group & frequency of your bookings with USDT.  Call us any time for details.</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">4.</FONT></B> USDT then will e-mail

back to your dive shop our <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Booking

Verification Letter</FONT></B>, confirming the clients' arrangements in

accurate detail, including reservation numbers, invoice &amp; commission

structure. Once you receive our verification letter, your dive shop's referral

is automatically logged into our reservation &amp; accounting system. You

are therefore guaranteed a commission, which in most cases will simply be deducted 

from the net balance due on your trip's account.  Group leaders may keep the commission 

to defray their own personal travel costs, or they may split the discount evenly among all 

team members, as you wish.</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">5.</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Here

are the rules by which your commissions are paid:</FONT></B><BR>

</P>



<UL>

<LI>Clients may pay your dive shop &amp; then you relay a 
cashier's check or wire transfer to USDT. Or you may ask clients to pay USDT directly.

<BR><BR>

</LI>



<LI>If your dive shop receives the client payment first &amp; then relays

it to USDT, you may deduct your commission up front, then send us the net

balance due.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>




<LI>Clients may pay USDT directly in three ways: via wire transfer or cashier's check for hotel, diving & vessel costs; or via  Mastercard

or Visa for air tickets only. Please note that USDT will not accept personal checks nor checks drawn on any 

private business.  The reason is a simple matter of logistics.  

We are required to remit your payments immediately to resorts & vessels, on your behalf, 

& our local banking system does not clear non-certified checks in fewer than 6-8 days.
<BR>

<BR>

</LI>






<LI>We are  conscientious about paying our commissions on time. We know

if we are reliable on our end of the agreement, we can count on your continued

loyalty as well.</LI>

</UL>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">6. U.S. Dive Travel will negotiate your commissions

for all lodging, diving, vessel &amp; side tour referrals depending on

group size &amp; number of services you book</FONT></B>. <BR>


(Please call us

at <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">952-953-4124</FONT></B> for details.) If your

dive shop or dive club is a regular contributor of referrals, we have a generous sliding

scale of commission over-rides (bonus points above standard commissions)

that depend on USDT's contract relationship with the resort or vessel booked;

&amp; also on your dive shop's annual volume. This bonus system rewards

our best allies for frequent referrals. This is an easy way for you, as

busy professionals, to collect hassle-free cash for a few minutes of phone

calls or faxes.</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">You also can earn</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">even

more generous over-rides for first-time booking of a group larger than

12 clients, each of whom books at least five nights lodging + at least

three days of diving or side tours + add-on air tickets overseas.</FONT></B></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">7.</FONT></B> If USDT books <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">regular

retail air tickets</FONT></B> for your clients, this service is never commissionable.

However, check out the good news about wholesale air tickets.....</P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">8.</FONT></B> I<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">f your

dive shop or dive club books wholesale air through the bulk-fare contract our partnership

holds with Continental Airlines </FONT></B>-- for international flights from most

major cities in the Lower 48 states to Belize, Honduras, Costa Rica, 

Hawaii, the South Pacific or Micronesia

 -- we'll sell your groups (small &amp; large) the air

spaces at low net rates, sometimes $70 - $250 per ticket below the

lowest discount retail price available.</P>



<P>Then your dive shop can mark these air tickets up to clients as you

see fit, observing our prime requirement -- that markups <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">never

exceed the lowest retail price </FONT></B>available for that airline, that

destination &amp; those specific travel dates on the day the client commits.

We ask our affiliate referring companies to exercise good judgment, &amp;

give your clients healthy discounts, so these bookings reflect well on

our shared reputations for integrity &amp; customer service. To better

see how our system for wholesale air tickets works, please click back to

our Home Page, then click on the hot-link for <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">&quot;Want

to be a Guide?&quot; </FONT></B>&amp; navigate to Index letter 'B.' </P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">9. </FONT></B>In cases when you might refer

customized land bookings to USDT (for example, vacation packages for which

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">USDT does NOT hold a wholesale contract </FONT></B>with

a given hotel, resort, vessel, dive operation) then USDT will pay your

commission in this manner: <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">one half the set dollar

amount per person for normal commissions</FONT></B>. This is because service

providers with whom USDT does not hold a wholesale contract will pay us

a much smaller commission amount, from which we then pay your dive shop or dive club. </P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">10. </FONT></B>Before USDT can cut a commission

statement to any dive shop or dive club, we respectfully request that <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">the

following documentation be mailed </FONT></B>to us for our permanent files:
