You are not alone. We have been

there. Done that. Never going back again. In fact, that's why we turned

away from the downtown grind back in March 1991 &amp; founded U.S. DIVE TRAVEL. 
So rest assured that you have colleagues

here in St. Paul, MN, U.S.A. who understand the lumpy corporate backpack you've

been lugging around so long. Now we'd like to fit you with a different

sort of backpack -- one where YOU choose the weight, the trail, the vistas

&amp; the pace. This is your life, amigo.</FONT> </P>


<CENTER><BR>
<IMG SRC="rainbow.gif" HEIGHT=3 WIDTH=550></CENTER><BR><BR>



<P>We'd be happy to help ease you away from the

joyless drill into a fresh new world of Wild Islands &amp; Wild Highlands, via our sister enterprise, Wild Island Expeditions.

There IS life after corporations.  There IS life after leering Neanderthal bosses & their

backbiting little Eddie Haskel henchmen, after years of the gnawing 9-to-5

grind. Believe us! Of course not every boss is a knuckle-dragger, nor every

middle manager a mouth breather. But there are just enough irregular people

stalking the halls of corporate America that vacations are a lifesaver

for most of us. </FONT></P>



<P>Only you know the right antidote for you, for Dem

Corporate Blues. So we're just here to kindle ideas, jump-start rusty imaginations,

fuel some long-filed-away dreams. We're here to serve you. If you think

the time is ripe for that sabbatical you've

been vowing to take for years; if you're a man or woman with the time,

the will, the spirit &amp; the vision, we have a galvanizing proposal for

you.</FONT></P>



<P>Why not consider an extended

leave of absence -- maybe a couple months, maybe more -- to

plan a wild once-in-a-lifetime adventure that combines all the life-positive

pursuits you love the most, plus the people you love the most? We've been

doing just this very thing several times a year for more than two decades.

If you want some exciting new ideas for trips, give us a ring. Meanwhile,

here are a few wistful ruminations to show you what is possible with a

little moxie.</FONT><BR>

<UL>

<LI>How about a custom

adventure honeymoon that combines rugged outdoor play &amp;

fine indoor luxury in the same 1 - 2 week trip? Maybe you'll be ocean kayaking

a hundred miles along the rocky coast of the Sea of Cortez in early February,

camping as you go in the pristine desert, tossing in a few days of hiking,

then following it all with a week of scuba diving among the gray whale

migration, the hammerhead schools &amp; the playful seal lions near La

Paz in Baja California, Mexico. There you'll stay in a cozy seaside resort

with a great beach &amp; a view most city denizens would give their left

leg to have.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Maybe you'll stay in a luxury hotel in <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Kailua-Kona</B>

</FONT>each night; then four-wheel drive &amp; hike one long day up to

the summit of Mauna Kea on <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Hawaii's Big Island,</FONT></B>

do a little snowboarding at 13,700 feet in the morning, then descend &amp;

the next day go sailing or deep-sea fishing. Maybe super early one morning

you'll drive to the beautiful Laupahoehoe Coast north of Hilo, then hike

up some nameless wilderness river &amp; go skinny-dipping in heavenly privacy

in a cool tropical pool two miles back from the road in a jungle lifted

straight from the pages of &quot;Green Mansions.&quot; Then maybe you'll

make the beautiful drive back to Kailua-Kona &amp; enjoy an electrifying

night dive among manta rays as friendly as puppies. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">There's

only one rule on your honeymoon, YOUR rule: &quot;We can do <I>whatever</I>

we want, <I>whenever</I> we want.&quot;</FONT></B></FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Then the followup John

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S. DIVE TRAVEL </FONT></B>has

helped scores of honeymoon couples plan trips so stress-free &amp; satisfying

that it's become one of our trademark specialties. We love to work with

honeymooners. Making sure you're delighted with the deal, the vistas, the

safety margin &amp; the thrills alike -- that is the most satisfying challenge

we encounter. You want a honeymoon that flies in the face of the ordinary?

You've got it! Are you keen on the South Pacific, anywhere among the Hawaiian

Islands, or South America? Then give us a call. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S.

Dive Travel </FONT></B>can craft an adventure you'll remember forever.

</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</P>



<UL>

<LI>How about a <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">reunion

of family or best friends</FONT></B> -- kind of a &quot;Big Chill Under

the Hot Sun&quot; -- on the Kona Coast, on Maui or Kauai, in Baja, Belize

or the Bay Islands of Honduras? Folks can take their significant others

&amp; everybody shares a great buffet breakfast in the morning, then does

as they please during the day, then you gather in late afternoon for the

big communal meal, &amp; later some romping nightlife? For those who want

scuba adventures, we can arrange them in a wink. Those who want to go hiking,

sea kayaking, snorkeling, sailing or deep-sea fishing, we can facilitate

those side tours, too. Everybody enjoys the same great discounts on air

tickets &amp; lodging.</FONT><BR>

</LI>

</UL>



<UL>

<LI>How about a <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Custom

Adventure Getaway</FONT></B>? Imagine this -- with our guide if you wish

or on your own -- you take a leisurely trekking pace (maybe a week, maybe 10-12

days) to hike up to the spectacular summit of <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Mount

Chimborazo</FONT></B>, a massive snow-clad volcano that towers 20,702 feet

above the Andes of Central Ecuador; &amp; from which on a clear day you

can relish one of the most breathtaking panoramas in the Americas. Then

after your summit victory you drop back down to Quito for a few days of

strolling the back alleys &amp; markets to enjoy Quechua culture, to cruise

for indigenous artifacts &amp; savor outstanding ethnic meals. Then you

fly about 600 miles west out to the world-renowned <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Galapagos

Islands</FONT>,</B> where you can board one of several luxury live-aboard

yachts for inspiring eco-tours (diving &amp; photo shoots) from 7 to 11

nights. </FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Then again imagine this trip. Let's say you<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">

<B>gather a gang of old college buddies</B></FONT><B> </B>&amp; you head

to the renowned Altiplano city of<FONT COLOR="#0000A0"> <B>La Paz, Bolivia</B></FONT>

during the ideal Andean winter weather of May &amp; June. There we'll guide

you, or we'll connect you to an outfitter who'll drive you by Jeep back

into the wondrous Cordillera Real to meet your llama herders. Then you

hike with a train of trusty llamas up &amp; over 15,000-foot passes into

hidden valleys that might see outsiders only a few times a decade. The

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Aymara Indians</FONT> </B>are kind &amp; gracious

&amp; you'll feel fully welcome as you explore some of the purest alpine

terrain on earth. Here life is so simple &amp; clean you may never want

to return home. It happened to us. We still remember those valleys with

deep emotion, &amp; a longing too. </FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>You'll be in the back country a couple weeks,

so you pack in all your food &amp; gear on the sturdy llamas, sleep in

roomy tents beneath skies so clear &amp; star-studded you can hardly believe

they're real. You will camp beside some of the most pristine alpine rivers

in the world, breathe air so pure it makes you sing, &amp; take day hikes

or two-day technical climbs to <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">the summits of

countless peaks</FONT></B>, many of them unclimbed or seldom climbed.</FONT></LI><BR><BR>



<LI>After a spirit-expanding trek you return to

La Paz, take a train across the forbidding Atacama Desert into<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">

<B>northern Chile</B></FONT>, then meander by bus down the stunningly beautiful

Chilean coast for a couple weeks, stopping to scuba dive for abalone &amp;

to enjoy the warm-hearted country people &amp; their hospitality. </FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>How about this one? Take a couple months off,

January &amp; February, the ideal time to hike &amp; climb in the <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>gorgeous

Mendoza region of the Argentine Andes.</B> </FONT>Maybe you want to try

climbing the daunting <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Cerro Aconcagua</FONT></B>,

at 22,834 feet the tallest peak in the Western Hemisphere, with a very

do-able 10-to-15-day standard route to the summit. It's a rugged mostly

non-technical hike on snow &amp; scree &amp; rock, with a decent trail

much of the way when the weather holds.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Then feeling as fit as a cougar after your life-changing

arrival on the highest piece of ground anywhere in the Americas, you could

head back down toward the Chilean border for some fine summer alpine skiing.

Later you might enjoy the outstanding cuisine &amp; wines of Mendoza city,

then maybe a long bus ride down to the Swiss-like <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">alpine

lakes near Bariloche</FONT></B> in the Argentine Andes.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Then you might top it all off with a side trip

up to <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Ilha Grande in Brazil</FONT></B>, or maybe

to <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Los Roques off the north coast of Venezuela</FONT></B>

for some soul-expanding scuba dives among big critters, enjoying warm water

with viz up to 200 feet! </FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Or maybe your pleasure is a flight down to <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Tierra

del Fuego</FONT></B> for some of the most scenic &amp; pleasant wilderness

hiking on the planet. Imagine hundreds of square miles of almost zero underbrush,

crisp cool air as clean as it was a century ago, lovely peaks only 3,000

to 4,000 feet above sea level that you can scale in perfect day climbs

from camp, with heart-&amp;-soul-massaging views of the coastal islands

&amp; fjords.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Then you get the bug to move again so you fly

north to <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Brazil</FONT></B>, maybe to <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Salvador

do Bahia, or Recife</FONT>,</B> maybe to the epicenter of Brazilian diving

at <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Ilha Grande &amp; Ilha Jorge Grego</B> </FONT>(about

65 miles south of Rio) for some mellow warm Atlantic scuba diving &amp;

body surfing &amp; some of the sweetest people in South America.</FONT><BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>Or maybe you decide to fly from Argentina up

to <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Venezuela</FONT></B>, one of the most geographically

amazing countries on earth, where you drop into <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Margarita

Island</FONT></B> to experience the famous scuba sites of <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Bird

Rock &amp; Mucura Coral Reef</B>.</FONT> Later after a relaxing week of

soaking up reef color &amp; sunshine, you take a short hop over to <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>Aruba</B>,

<B>Bonaire or Curacao</B></FONT><B> </B>to round off your quest in the

lap of South Caribbean waterfront luxury.</FONT></LI>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>7. USDT</B> </FONT>normally

offers prospective clients two free hours of initial research, to help

you jell your ideas comfortably. Then once we fax or E-mail you back after

the initial research to give you a status report, we'll ask you whether

you're interested in committing to a <FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B>CUSTOMIZED

you get the <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Hessburg Hat Guarantee</FONT></B>.

Can't beat this, amigos. If you can prove that your trip was an utter bomb,

&amp; you were unhappy to the quick, just go purchase the hat of your choice

overseas &amp; when you return your agent will eat one bite of that hat

right before your eyes, while the video cameras roll. Thus far in three decades 

of world travel, Susan & John Hessburg have picked dental

floss, quinoa grains, desert sand, storm-blown alpine grit, herring ribs

&amp; seaweed out of their teeth -- but still <I>not one tiny molecule of hat.</I>

Thank you Lord for small blessings. And a vigorous thank-you to our many

good repeat clients, for your faith &amp; confidence &amp; your business.

It's been a great time helping you all!</FONT><BR>

Yours in deep seas &amp; high adventure....<BR>
