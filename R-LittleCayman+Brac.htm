<p>Let's start this review with a wonderfully simple fact: of the many dozens of tropical
resorts that line the beaches of the Cayman Islands, two luxury Caribbean resorts have consistently
ranked at the top of diver magazine reader polls, &amp; travel professional
surveys over &amp; over again.&nbsp; They are Little Cayman Beach Resort
&amp; Brac Reef Beach Resort.&nbsp; These are bona fide 4+ star resorts,
beautiful luxury lodging on beaches that are balm to city-weary souls;
&amp; they are just plain good bets for dive travelers looking for top
value.&nbsp; These resorts are a little more expensive than some of their
island competitors, but Godiva chocolates cost more than a supermarket
nougat bar, for a lot of the same reasons.&nbsp; We feel solid about recommending
these places with enthusiasm for dive vacations or snorkeling vacations, as you wish.
<p>There must be something special about this Little Cayman island, this
off-the-beaten-path destination -- if dive magazine editors &amp; world-renowned
photographers are talking about it so consistently.&nbsp; Granted there
are such abundant swells of hot air billowing from many of the diving magazines
nowadays, you'd almost think their editors need truth serum, or at least
PR puffery regulators.&nbsp; But when respected industry figures like Philippe
Cousteau &amp; ace photographer David Doubilet sing the praises of Little
Cayman Island, year after year, one needs to do more than arch an eyebrow.&nbsp;
These gents say that scuba vistas here off Little Cayman Island, &amp;
Cayman Brac too, are among the finest diving experiences available among all 
luxury Caribbean resorts.&nbsp; The fact is that they are correct.
<p>There is so much hype in the scuba diving world that it's often hard
to separate the skates from the skate scat.&nbsp; But the fact that hundreds
of experienced divers each year hardly can wait to return to Little Cayman,
&amp; Cayman Brac, must mean something pretty special is going on out there.
<p>It is actually.&nbsp; It's a little thing called enjoyment.&nbsp; Pure
unadulterated diving joy.&nbsp; With no annoying touristy crowds to boot.&nbsp;
A recent survey taken by the editors of Rodale's Scuba Diving Magazine,
a respected journal of scuba matters worldwide &amp; the last objectively
balanced magazine in a dive profession peppered with puff-piece periodicals, 
states that readers voted Little Cayman Beach Resort the best
wall diving destination in the Caribbean (thanks to the Bloody Bay
Wall!).&nbsp; Those same readers also voted Little Cayman Beach Resort
the second best reef diving in the Caribbean.&nbsp; Rodale's readers further
ranked Little Cayman as one of the Caribbean's top 5 destinations for underwater
photos &amp; advanced diving thrills.  Remember, these isles welcome non-divers to enjoy 
world-class snorkeling vacations, as well as dive trips.  No regulator bias here, gang! Snorkeling is 
just as cool in the Cayman Islands as scuba diving, so hang loose, mon.  Few luxury Caribbean resorts can ever 
hope to match the topside amenities & sheer adventure spectrum available in these waters.

<p><b>GEOGRAPHIC DETAILS about LITTLE CAYMAN ISLAND:</b>
<br>Little Cayman Island is 87 miles northeast of Grand Cayman, five miles
west of Cayman Brac, 480 miles from Miami &amp; 90 miles south of Havana.
The island itself is 10 miles long &amp; 1 mile wide.&nbsp; There are daily

be met by resort staff &amp; transferred to the resort.&nbsp; Island Air
does have a weight limit of 55 pounds per person &amp; excess charges currently
run about $0.55 per pound. The atmosphere on Little Cayman is very informal

<br>For several years in a row, more than&nbsp; 8,000 or more scuba divers put pen to
paper &amp; rated their favorite scuba diving sites, dive resorts &amp; dive operations, according
to Rodale's Scuba Diving Reader's Choice Awards. Little Cayman home to
Reef Divers scored as having the Best Wall Diving, Fish Life, Visibility,
Healthiest Marine Environment, Dive Operation, Resort, Staff, Restaurant.&nbsp;

to David Doubilet to John Wanderlust &amp; Jane Traveler, just about every scuba diver
has stated that Little Cayman is one of the world's premier dive destinations

they are also favored for their many safety features.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>DIVE SHOP PROTOCOLS</b>
<br>After checking in you'll be asked to complete a history form &amp;
to return it to the dive shop. Don't forget your C card.&nbsp; You won't
be able to enjoy any Cayman diving without it. Our boardwalks lead from your room to all points
of interest, including the&nbsp; pier for a look at the dive boats you
will be using. The boats depart each morning at 8:30 a.m. &amp; again at
2:30 p.m. Water temperature ranges from 76-78 degrees F. in winter to 76-86
degrees F in summer.&nbsp; Divers are encouraged to place their gear in
a bag outside their door the first morning. The dive staff will pick it
up &amp; take it to the boat. The first time, divers are asked to set up
their gear. After that the dive staff&nbsp; will take care of everything,
including packing up your gear &amp; rinsing it after the day's diving.

<p><br><b>DIVING SERVICES HIGHLIGHTED:</b>
<br>Divers don't have to lug their gear every day from their rooms. Upon
checking in at the dive shop, divers receive a Reef Divers bag. They put
their gear in the bag, place it outside their door the first morning, &amp;
the dive staff will take it to the boat. The scuba diver sets up his/her gear
the first time. After that Reef Divers changes their tanks after every
dive. At day's end, we take care of rinsing BCs, Regulators &amp; weight
belts on the boat.
<br>Here are the main reasons why our dive shop service is world-class
on Little Cayman island:
<ul>
<li>
Divers take their wetsuits &amp; skins to the storage area to dry &amp;
their photo/video gear to their rooms.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>

<br><b><font size=+1>MOST POPULAR DIVE SITES on LITTLE CAYMAN ISLAND:</font></b>
</font>

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Cascades:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </font>

This is the first &amp; most northern
Little Cayman diving site in the Jackson Point area. Once you've entered the water &amp; started
down you will understand the meaning of Cascades. This is the area where
it all cascades down to "La La Land". You will find turtles, sharks, Eagle
&amp; Sting Rays on this far out site, as well as conch. The coral heads
in this area look like small mountain ranges. Makes for great wide angle
photos.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Paul's Anchors:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This Little Cayman diving site is known for its majestic,
gently sloping drop-off. You will find in &amp; around the rubble Sand
Tile Fish, octopus &amp; Yellow Headed Jaw Fish. There are many anchors
located on this site. One of interest is about 10_ tall with a large rope
ring at the top. Makes for a great photo backdrop. This site is also known
for its abundance of sea life, turtles, sharks &amp; Green Morays, not
to forget the Spotted Eagle Rays.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Nancy's Cup of Tea (a/k/a Magic Roundabout):&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </font>

This Little Cayman diving 
site is named after Nancy Sefton, author of Caribbean Reef Invertebrates.
From this site you can visit Mike's Mount to the south &amp; Paul's Anchors
to the north. The wall reef &amp; inner reef abound with marine life. The
main point of interest is an outcropping from the wall. There are several
species of Black Coral to be found in &amp; around this outcropping. Eagle
Rays, Sting Rays &amp; sharks, as well as turtles, are among some of the
large critters to be seen here. A Bat Fish has been seen at this site,
as well. Yellow Headed Jaw Fish &amp; Sand Tile Fish will be found among
the rubble, along with conch.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Mike's Mount:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </font>

There's a lot to be found, starting
with this Little Cayman diving dive site. As you move in a northerly direction out towards the
Cascades site, you can take a look at some history. The first thing to
be found is a small cannon on this site. Moving on north, there are many
anchors to be seen. You will have to look for these artifacts, for they
have been transformed to look like their surroundings. There are tunnels
through the wall (to "La La Land") as well as a cannon in the shallows.
We've seen sharks, turtles, Spotted Eagle Rays, Sting Rays, eels, etc.
There are friendly Queen Trigger &amp; French Angels, as well as Grouper.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>The Meadows:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This Little Cayman diving site affords both deep &amp;
shallow diving, for scuba diver or snorkeler. You can take the dropoff to "La La Land" or cruise through
many canyons &amp; sand flats. You will find friendly French Angels &amp;
Queen Triggers. In among the rubble areas you will find Jaw Fish, Sand
Tile Fish &amp; many other small dwellers of the reef. You may also find
sharks, Spotted Eagle Rays, Sting Rays &amp; turtles swimming here. There
are some great tunnels that open onto the wall. Makes for a great backdrop
for pictures of your friends with wide angle or standard lens. Great video,
too!

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Eagle Ray Roundup:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This Little Cayman diving site is a large sandy
area typical of Jackson Bay. Occasionally we find more than one or two
Eagle Rays, here. The area is surrounded by large coral head formations
&amp; bordered by the wall reef. You will find large Parrot Fish munching
on the sand, as well as Sting Rays &amp; Hog Snapper. There are also friendly
French Angels &amp; Grouper, here.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Jackson's Reef &amp; Wall:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This Little Cayman diving site abounds with
marine life. During the day you will find some very friendly French Angels
that will be more than willing to have their pictures taken. Eagle Rays,
Sting Rays, Yellow Sting Rays &amp; Moray Eels (both Green &amp; Black
&amp; White), are frequently seen here. In &amp; around the rubble area,
you will find many small fish such as Yellow Headed jaw Fish, Sand Tile
Fish, Sand Divers &amp; a variety of juveniles. For the night diver there
are a lot of night dwellers to be seen -- Octopus, Basket Starfish &amp;
Orange Ball Anemones to name a few.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Cumber's Caves:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

The main feature of this Little Cayman diving site
are the four tunnels that go through the wall reef. They all start at about
45 to 50 feet &amp; exist on the outside of the wall at about 100 feet.
There is an anchor at the entrance of one. In the sandy area you will find
Garden Eels, conch, as well as Eagle Rays &amp; Southern Sting Rays. Along
the base of the mini-wall you will find among the rubble many smaller fish
like the Yellow Headed Jaw Fish. This area is also a great night dive,
&amp; affords a photographic range from wide angle to macro, as well as
video.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Bus Stop:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

This Little Cayman diving site gets its name from the remains
of a school bus on the shore. You will find a large sand wash inside the
wall reef that runs through the wall &amp; dumps into "La La Land" This
chute opened up in December, 1989 during a northwester. You will note the
dead zone from where the sand originally was -- about 20_ or so. Along
the wall east of the mooring point there is a large Barrel Sponge which
has a large hole in the side. Makes for interesting photos.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Sarah's Set:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This Little Cayman diving site affords both deep &amp;
shallow diving. You can take the dropoff to "La La Land" or cruise through
many canyons &amp; sand flats. You will find friendly French Angels &amp;
Queen Triggers. In among the rubble areas you will find Jaw Fish, Sand
Tile Fish &amp; many other small dwellers on the reef. You may also find
sharks, Spotted Eagle Rays, Sting Rays &amp; turtles swimming here from
time to time. There are some great tunnels that open onto the wall. Makes
for great backdrop pictures of your friends with wide angle or standard
lens. Great for video, too!

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Blacktip Boulevard:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This Little Cayman diving site is named for the
number of sightings of Blacktip Sharks. The mooring is set at the inner
edge of the wall reef. The reef itself is a gentle slope to the dropoff.
There are many sand grooves to explore in this area. In the sand you will
find Yellow Headed Jaw Fish, along with Sand Tile Fish &amp; many other
small fish. In the sand area you will find Garden Eels, Southern Sting
Rays, conch &amp; Eagle Rays.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Mixing Bowl (3 Fathom Wall):&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </font>

The name "Mixing
Bowl" comes from the local divers, so named because this is where Jackson's
Bay &amp; Bloody Bay share a common border. The site is also known as "3
Fathom Wall" (6 feet/fathom x 3 = 18 feet). Also known as Bloody, Jackson &amp;
Ball's Bay. There is much to be seen here, &amp; you will notice a great
difference between both areas: Jackson's with its gentle sloping to the
wall &amp; Bloody Bay's vertical drop into dark depths below. Sharks, Eagle
Rays &amp; Turtles are commonly found cruising the Wall in both bays, along
with Queen Angels, French Angels &amp; Gray Angels. On the Bloody Bay side,
you'll find Sailfin Blennys &amp; large schools of Stoplight Parrot Fish,
Scorpion Fish &amp; many others. Great for video, both macro &amp; wide
angle still photography, standard &amp; closeup, wide angle (20mm &amp;
15mm) &amp; macro. On the Jackson's side you will find Yellow Headed Jaw
Fish, Sand Tile Fish, Southern Sting Rays, turtles &amp; more Little Cayman diving delights.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Marilyn's Cut:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

Marilyn's Cut is made up of a
modern day Danforth anchor. This Little Cayman diving site is within easy distance of both Mixing
Bowl to the east, &amp; Donna's Delight to the west. The shallows are a
very gentle slope to the dropoff which starts at an average depth of 25
feet. On the wall you will find a variety of sponge &amp; corals. The east
cut has Black Coral on both sides &amp; a very large Barrel Sponge on the
west side. The shallows abound with a variety of fish -- some small, some
large. Pot holes abound with many juveniles.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Donna's Delight:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

Donna's Delight is very much
like Marilyn's Cut. One thing that seems to be abundant on this site are
Flamingo Tongue shells. Nurse Sharks are frequently seen along these sites.
You may find Flying Gurnards in the shallow areas, too. Sailfin Blenny
are common, but you really need a trained eye to find them. They are only
about 1-1/4" to 1-1/2" long. They dance above their burrows &amp; fleet
back into them when approached.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>The Chimney (Randy's Gazebo):</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

The chimney &amp;
archway are the greatest points of interest, here. The chimney entrance
starts at about 75&cent; &amp; exits vertically at about 40 feet on the
top of the wall. The arch is east of the mooring, approximately 10 feet,
opening on the blue water side at about 75 feet. This makes for a great
backdrop for photos of divers coming through from open water. In the shallows,
as with most of the sites, you will find an array of juveniles. Sharks
&amp; rays are seen cruising to these Little Cayman diving areas as well. The wall offers great
views as well as wide angle &amp; standard lenses. The top of the wall
offers the same as well as good macro opp's.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Great Wall:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </font>

There are two words to describe this
site -- FULLY AWESOME.&nbsp; In the shallows you will find many large coral
heads abundant with small reef fish. You may find cleaning stations here,
as well. Scorpion Fish are found frequently around their base structure.
You will also find the Sailfin Blennys in the shallows (hard bottom area
with algae growth) dancing above their burrows. The wall is almost vertical.
It will leave you in awe when you find your way off the wall &amp; turn
around to look back. Black Coral is abundant in this area &amp; makes a
great backdrop for photos. You may see Eagle Rays and/or sharks cruising
the wall. Big game fish have been seen at times. There are also many different
types of sponges in an array of colors.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Lea Lea's Lookout:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

Lobsters, Spider Crabs, Scorpion
Fish, Jaw Fish &amp; Sailfin Blennys are among some of the critters that
can be seen, along with turtles, sharks, Eagle Rays, Green Morays &amp;
Black &amp; White Morays. Sailfin Blennys live in holes on the hard bottom.
Jaw Fish live in holes among the rubble &amp; sand. Both of these critters
dance vertically above their dens in this Little Cayman diving classic.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Coconut Walk:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

Coconut Walk is the island name
for Coconut Grove. The main point of interest on this site is a large stand
of Pillar Coral. It is one of the few hard corals, here. Polyps are extended
from it to feed during daylight hours. This coral is very slow growing
&amp; is extremely delicate, so please -- DO NOT TOUCH! There are many
tunnels through the outcroppings with sand &amp; rubble shoots. You will
find large Barrel Sponges at depths of 60 feet +. They are best photographed
with a wide angle lens &amp; someone alongside or above to give non-diving
people an idea of how large these sponges can be. The shallows in this
area afford the same array of marine life that is found along Bloody Bay
&amp; Jackson's Bay.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Barracuda Bight:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This is the next to last site
in Bloody Bay. We have in this area fingers or outcroppings from the wall.
You will find in the shallows the Sailfin Blennys &amp; many juveniles
&amp; small fish. There are many crevices &amp; overhangs to explore, here.
Lobster &amp; Spider Crabs are found here, quite often along with Nurse
Sharks, Green Moray &amp; Black &amp; White Moray Eels.

<FONT COLOR="FF0000">
<p><b>Joy's Joy:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This is the last dive site in the
Bloody Bay area, another Little Cayman diving classic. The area is much the same as Barracuda Bight with its
many outcropping fingers. From the mini-wall or ridge, starting at about
25 feet, there is a gradual sloping to the dropoff. There are lots of nooks
&amp; crannies to explore. You may find lobsters (Spiny, Rock &amp; Slipper)
hiding in this area, along with octopus &amp; Flamingo Scallops. You may
also sight Eagle Rays &amp; sharks cruising this area.

<p><b>BACKGROUND INFO on the ISLAND &amp; TOURS AVAILABLE:</b>
<br>The Cayman Islands are located in the Caribbean Sea south of Cuba,
from which they are separated at the closest point by about 150 miles.
The three islands are an outcropping of the Cayman Ridge, a submarine mountain
range that extends west from the Sierra Maestra mountain range in Cuba.
Grand Cayman is the largest of the islands with 121 square miles. By contrast
Little Cayman, the smallest of the three islands, is only one mile by ten.
The total land area of the three islands is 162 square miles, or approximately
that of Austin, Texas.&nbsp; All three islands are low lying &amp; are
composed of limestone &amp; consolidated coral. The highest point on Little
Cayman is only 40 feet in elevation. While tales of pirates abound, most
likely Little Cayman saw few visitors until recent times. That lack of
human habitation allowed the reefs &amp; walls to grow &amp; flourish. 
Scuba diving vacations & snorkeling vacations are the lifeblood of these Cayman dive resorts. 

<p>Today, we glory in the magnificent underwater world that time created.
The harsh conditions that keep the islands isolated are also the conditions
we seek to protect for the sake of the marine &amp; bird life. Freshwater
comes to us free only when it rains &amp; the resort has built cisterns
to collect it. Unfortunately, it is not enough to provide for all the guests,
so they have built a reverse osmosis plant to produce the additional fresh
water needed.
<p>The resort wisely asks all guests to conserve where possible. Washing
soap can pollute our waters so we ask guests if they wish to use fresh
towels, to place their used towels in the bath tub. For those that guests
intend to use again, we request that they hang them on the towel rack.
Trash should be disposed of in containers provided.&nbsp; When guests leave
their rooms, we encourage them to turn off the lights &amp; turn up the
air conditioner. The pristine environment everyone comes to see will be
preserved for future generations of divers &amp; naturalists.

<p><br><b>CAYMAN BRAC SIDE-TOURS</b>
<br>Cayman Brac is the middle sister of the three Cayman Islands. It is
a coral island surrounded by reef with a population of about 1200 residents.
It has changed very little since it was discovered in 1503 by Christopher
Columbus. Despite its history of pirate adventure &amp; hidden treasure,
it remains a peaceful quiet hideaway not only for divers &amp; snorkelers,
but also for sports fishermen, bird watchers &amp; just relaxing. Cayman
Brac is recognized for the unspoiled natural beauty of its spectacular
marine environment. Much of its coral reef has been protected for future
generations to enjoy by its designation as a marine park by the Cayman
Marine Conservation Laws. Snorkeling off the white sandy beaches or ironshore
is excellent.
<p>World-class bonefishing is found both inside &amp; outside the reef.
Light tackle spinning &amp; fly fishing the shallow flats for bone, tarpon
&amp; permit is second to none. Beyond the reef the waters abound year
round with big game fish -- marlin, tuna &amp; wahoo.
<p>Most of the island's interior is highlighted by the bluff, a distinctive
limestone cliff that juts up to 140 feet at the Brac's eastern end. The
bluff supports a nature preserve boasting more than 150 species of birds
&amp; abundant flora &amp; fauna, including the rare green parrot, iguanas,
snow egrets &amp; a variety of tropical plans &amp; flowers, are all to
be seen &amp; photographed at leisure.&nbsp; Visit the bluff &amp; its
many caves. Listen to pirate tales of Blackbeard, Anne Bonny &amp; buried
treasure. See where Brackers have sought refuge from storm &amp; flood.
Experience the breathtaking view from the lighthouse overlooking the sea
below. Tour the local museum for an interesting glimpse of the past.
<p>Brac Reef Beach Resort provides a Caribbean retreat away from the pressures
of modem life while catering to the comfort of guests. On the beautiful
southwest shore of Cayman Brac, the resort is like a little bit of paradise
nestled among the palms, seagrape trees &amp; lush tropical landscaping.
In sharp contrast to this serene delicate scene is the Island's eastern
side with its spectacular 140 foot limestone bluff rising majestically
&amp; forcefully from the sea. The Brac lies in the middle of the sea,
the exposed tip of an underwater mountain. These islands differ from many
others in the Caribbean in that they are limestone rather than volcanic
in composition. Cayman Brac has a history of Scotch influence &amp; takes
its name from the Gaelic word "Brac", which translates to "bluff'. All
along the walls of Brac's enormous cliff are the petrified remains of eons
of marine life -- fossilized corals &amp; sea creatures immortalized forever
in this monument to nature.
<p>Cayman Brac is truly unique in its structure, as well as its population
-- a mixture of settlers from throughout the Caribbean, Europe &amp; Africa.
These friendly, warm "Brackers" as they are called, welcome visitors to
their island with open arms. The pleasant, uncomplicated lifestyle of the
Brac surely must have some influence on the amicable attitude of the locals
&amp; has definitely been responsible for infusing some harried visitors
with a healthy dose of mellow relaxation. Unlike its more developed sister,
Grand Cayman, the Brac has managed to remain relatively unspoiled, although
modem enough to provide the comforts of home. The people of the island
have always been linked to the sea, with many of the men leaving home to
sail &amp; the rest remaining to build ships.
<p>A strong economy provides financial resources for the island, so roads
are good &amp; jet travel to Cayman Brac has been facilitated by the addition
of a modem airport capable of accommodating Cayman Airways' 737s, as well
as Island Air's twin-engined fleet of Twin Otters, Navajos, etc. But, beyond
these modern conveniences, Cayman Brac retains the distinct charm of the
Caribbean of many years ago. Gingerbread details on pastel colored houses
are the creations of local carpenters trained as woodcraft artists for
shipbuilding. The quiet of the streets is broken only by friendly greetings
&amp; welcomes for visiting tourists. On the bluffs cattle are tended &amp;
locals utilize the land for vegetable crops. Hikers will find unlimited
areas to explore. The natural vegetation of the island includes many tropical
plants &amp; fruit trees - mango &amp; papayas, as well as beautiful wild
orchids.

<p><b><font size=+1>CLASSIC DIVE SITES on CAYMAN BRAC:</font></b>
</font>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<p><b>Russian Frigate 356 - MV Capt. Keith Tibbetts:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
Sunk in September, 1996, this 330 foot vessel is an amazing dive. The bow
sits in 110 feet of water, with the stern in 65 feet. The radar tower starts
in about 15 feet so this is an excellent dive for snorkelers as well as
divers. Over 100 species of marine life have been documented in the short
time she has been down. The wreck has been made diver friendly &amp; portions
of it are penetrable.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<p><b>Tarpon Reef:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>

This medium depth spur &amp; groove
area along the Brac's south side is home to several dozen Tarpon that spend
their days clustered in groups among the tunnels &amp; crevices. These
shimmering, silvery fish, some reaching up to five feet in length, will
remain fairly calm &amp; still when approached slowly, providing great
photographic opportunities. Another inspiring photo subject is a nearby
stand of Pillar Coral, rising along a knoll looking somewhat like a tall
cactus towering over the seascape. Tarpon Reef features several of these
formations as well as Elkhorn Corals, Star Corals &amp; abundant soft corals.&nbsp;
The sand gullies between the large ridges of Tarpon Reef reach a depth
of about 50 feet while the crests of the ridges may rise to within 20 feet
of the surface. Visibility at this site tends to be quite variable. Nurse
Sharks are sometimes seen in the undercuts, &amp; along the tops of the
ridges your find the usual assortment of colorful tropicals, an occasional
Barracuda &amp; a variety of Parrotfish<b></b>

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<p><b>Wilderness Wall:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </font>

One of several pristine wall
sites along the Brac's south side. Wilderness Wall evokes a feeling of
the mystical &amp; primordial. This dramatically plunging drop-off is nearly
virginal in its presentation, with an abundance of healthy corals, sponges
&amp; a wealth of marine life to captivate even the most jaded diver. Canyons
&amp; crevices cut through the wall all along the drop-off, some plunging
far beyond the reach of earthly visitors. An immense pinnacle rises away
from the wall to within 100 feet of the surface (forming a corridor along
the reef for pelagics up from the abyss), while the wall itself begins
at about 50 feet.&nbsp; Wilderness Wall attracts a large following of Nassau
Groupers, stingrays, turtles, schooling Horse-Eye Jacks, Snappers &amp;
Angelfish. Delicate gorgonians hang along the sides of the crevices &amp;
promontories, accented by rope sponges, hard corals &amp; large, bulbous
tube sponges. The sponges in this area reach enormous proportions &amp;
come in brilliant shades of red, yellow, orange, purple &amp; green.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<p><b>Bert Brothers' Boulders:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>

 The Bert Brothers are
a family of Brackers long involved in local dive operations.&nbsp; Their
namesake is appropriately one of the most beautiful dive spots off the
island. A medium depth reef at 40 feet, this north side site is dominated
by tightly spaced spur &amp; groove ridges that form mountains of coralheads
between the intershore sands &amp; the offshore wall. The tops of the ridges
are graced with beautiful Elkhorn Corals, the narrow gullies between feature
soft corals, tube sponges &amp; hard corals.&nbsp; Swim-throughs &amp;
large undercuts provide hiding places for a large Green Moray Eel that
has been in residence here from some time. The sponge-trimmed openings
are also perfect framing for wide angle photography, with filtering sunlight
pouring down through the gaping chasms to the sandy floor.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<p><b>Greenhouse:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </font>

Greenhouse is not just an ordinary
medium depth dive site. Here, among the spur &amp; groove formations, you're
likely to find all sorts of creatures. Marine life at Greenhouse may include
Sharptail Eels winding through crevices in the gullies looking for a meal,
friendly Angelfish darting in &amp; out of the soft corals &amp; turtles
cruising over the tops of the coral ridges. With its proximity to the Brac's
shallow north shoreline, Greenhouse also has frequent visits from schooling
Squid, hovering in groups of a dozen or more near the mooring or lining
up in formation near the surface. Macro photographers will sometimes find
Flamingo Tongues perched on the large purple seafans at 20 to 30 feet as
well as Arrowcrabs, Longspined Sea Urchins &amp; Bristleworms hiding among
the cracks. The coral ridges are adorned with abundant hard &amp; soft
corals, Tube Sponges &amp; Barrel Sponges.

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<p><b>East Chute/Cayman Mariner:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; </font>

East Chute, one of
the Brac's most popular sites, features not only the exhilarating wall,
but also a small wreck along the inshore sand area. East Chute begins at
about 65 feet, marked by a large, sand-filled canyon spilling over the
ledge into the abyss. The wall is decorated with Red Rope Sponges, Yellow
Tube Sponges &amp; large Barrel Sponges.&nbsp; A short distance inshore,
in 55 feet on a sand bottom, the Cayman Mariner rests upright &amp; intact,
with a modest growth of soft corals &amp; sponges along her exterior &amp;
inside the hull. Sunk in 1986, she now attracts exciting marine life such
as turtles, Green Moray Eels &amp; schooling Barracuda.

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT></b>

<P>All dive package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging, side tour & diving prices are traditionally stable, as are live-aboard package prices; however air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard per FAA rules. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; & that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our tropical vacation experts normally secure excellent wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated all U.S.-based airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals.  Early is good when seeking the best air ticket rates.</P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above scuba diving packages are prices for only the live-aboard portion of your dive trip, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms.  On most live-aboards, there will be no triple-occupancy staterooms offered. International air tickets & commuter "island-hopper" seats are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets & the dive vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $35 per person for the land portion + $20 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. </P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for all of our live-aboards, dive resorts, side tours & air ticket specials is by e-check, ACH or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer only. No personal checks or credit cards will be accepted for the live-aboard or land portion of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest & our prices the lowest in this industry, & thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa & Mastercard. For ultra-discount wholesale air tickets, USDT accepts only cashier's checks or wire transfers, please.</P>

<P>Remember, all tropical vacation clients to all foreign destinations will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $35 - $45 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; & away you go. Best of luck with your dive travel plans. We hope your scuba diving vacation is a safe & satisfying adventure. Blessings & best wishes with ALL your dive vacations.</P>
