<P>After more than 40 scuba diving trips to various Hawaiian Islands since 1990 -- to

explore new dive sites, revisit the old classics &amp; establish new wholesale

tropical vacation packages -- the management of U.S. Dive Travel feels confident

in saying that we are America's foremost specialists in resort-based Hawaii

diving. We have visited all seven of the inhabited Neighbor Islands of

Hawaii -- including mysterious Niihau -- &amp; most of these islands multiple

times. Our mission in Hawaii is always to do new shore dives &amp; boat

dives each trip, &amp; to examine countless hotels, charter vessels &amp;

dive operations for safety &amp; service quality. We try to better serve

our dive travel clients with information derived from hands-on &amp; fins-on experience.</P>



<P>Based on our working dive trips to Hawaii, we believe The Manele Bay Hotel

&amp; its sister property, The Lodge at Koele, both situated on the secluded

island of Lanai, are the most beautiful &amp; luxuriously appointed hotels

anywhere in Hawaii. These secluded Hawaiian resorts are so impeccably maintained, with service

standards &amp; amenities that equal the finest European &amp; Pacific

Rim luxury hotels, that even exuberant words fail to give them fair measure.

Photos will help a little; but you have to see these hotels yourself to

understand why even veteran tropical travelers who worship the Jaded Guru -- Bendar

Dundat -- yes the ones who are wearily sure they've seen it all, would

be gratified by such inimitable excellence.</P>



<P>The first good news is this: it's easy to get to Lanai. It is smack dab in the middle of the 
Hawaiian Islands.  The island of Lanai is

about 10 miles west of Maui; &amp; there are scores of flights every week

from Honolulu &amp; the Neighbor Islands. The inter-island dash flights

from Honolulu, on Aloha Island Air &amp; Hawaiian Air Jet Service take

less than half an hour to Lanai; &amp; the views are vividly inspiring.</P>



<P>Our Lanai diving & snorkeling packages are not for everybody. Lanai

is no island for vacation bargain hunters, nor for party-hearty dive chums

seeking Cozumel-like specials, nor for Waikiki-style diving &quot;cattle

boats.&quot; The Lanai level of service &amp; comfort was designed only

for those couples &amp; singles who insist upon, &amp; are used to experiencing,

the zenith of perfection on their getaways. Not one &quot;t&quot; is left

uncrossed on Lanai island. This quiet little plantation isle, once a center

for Dole Company pineapple production, has evolved into one of the world's

top resort destinations, well on a par with Fiji's Vatulele &amp; Australia's

Lizard Island. In short, after visiting some two dozen countries in 25

years, U. S. Dive Travel's directors can affirm, with feeling, that Lanai diving & Lanai lodging together are 

a powerful duo, for a Hawaii diving vacation that 

has few peers.</P>



<P>Microsoft chairman Bill Gates &amp; his entourage visited Lanai's resorts

for a week, &amp; enjoyed the most gala wedding party Hawaii has ever seen

-- back in the summer of 1994. We arrived on Lanai island just a short while

after the Bill Gates group departed, while the local buzz was hot. People are

still talking, a little wide-eyed, about that Bill Gates wedding party -- on both

sides of the Pacific. And with very good reason.</P>



<P>The Manele Bay Hotel, graced by meticulous flower gardens, pools, waterfalls,

&amp; lush green lawns, was designed with a uniquely gracious meld of traditional

Hawaiian Kama'aina &amp; Mediterranean-style architecture. Manele Bay Hotel sits

high atop a promontory overlooking the lovely white-sand crescent of Hulopo'e

Beach. Both outside &amp; inside, Manele Bay Hotel seems like the embodiment of a

dream.</P>



<P>The inside decor of Manele Bay Hotel borrows from Asian &amp; Mediterranean motifs, with

huge salons &amp; foyers that seem palatial. Cool breezes constantly filter

through most of the great halls &amp; public rooms in Manele, carrying the fresh

redolence of flowers &amp; plants in the outside gardens.</P>



<P>One great advantage for divers in staying at The Manele Bay Hotel is

that Trilogy's diving vessels can pick you up right at the beach &amp;

whisk you out to some of the finest reef diving in the Hawaiian chain,

only a few miles away, along the southwestern coast of Lanai. Here you'll

be thrilled by classic Lanai diving sanctuaries such as the First &amp; Second

Cathedrals, Monolith, the Catacombs, Knob Hill &amp; Grand Canyon. The

abundant &amp; colorful marine life, &amp; the dramatic underwater rock

grottoes off southern Lanai, are second among Hawaii's best diving only

to the virgin coral wilderness of Niihau, &quot;The Forbidden Island&quot;

off Kauai, &amp; the wild South Shore of Molokai. The water clarity, &amp;

the freshness of Lanai's reef habitat, are enough to rouse any veteran

diver's soul. You'll see awesome rock spires &amp; archways, caves &amp;

cubbyholes with their healthy denizens: moray eels, mantas, whitetips,

spotted pufferfish, surgeonfish &amp; wonderful turtles.  Just thinking about Lanai diving makes our 

staff want to mutiny & take the next plane to Lanai to escape Seattle's drizzle!</P>

<P>The Manele Bay Hotel offers several world-class restaurants &amp; lounges,

along with a fitness center, massage service, pool &amp; a golf course

designed by Jack Nicklaus -- &quot;The Challenge at Manele -- that would

lure most dedicated golfers into green nirvana. If you're looking for apres-scuba

activities (of course wait sufficient time after your dives before you

ascend to the highlands!) here's what else you can enjoy on Lanai:<BR>

</P>



<UL>

<LI>There are glorious snorkeling pools near Hulopo'e Bay on Lanai island, where you'll

sometimes get to see spinner dolphins cavorting, or humpback whales breaching

during the winter &amp; spring. The summer &amp; fall ocean is warm, calm

&amp; clear on Lanai most every year, ideal for safe snorkeling.  Lanai diving is for scuba divers as well as 
those folks who simply want to snorkel.  Either way, Lanai diving is sure to please with the greatest of ease. 
And it's certainly not all about scuba diving on this vastly enjoyable isle.  Scuba vacations, to be really fun & 
fulfilling, have to take in a bit of the island's natural heritage as well, most of our Lanai clients agree.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>You can sail along the Southwest Coast with our vessel associates,

Trilogy, to see the caves &amp; royal fishing grounds of King Kamehameha.

Take your camera &amp; enjoy!<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>You can hike around the ancient settlement &amp; remote white-sand

beaches along the back road to Keomoku. There are some amazing beachside

back roads on Lanai.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>You can take a relaxing horseback jaunt along the highland ridge line

that transects Lanai, where the views are sweeping &amp; majestic, &amp;

the air is cool &amp; clean.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>You can visit the hulking austere rock formations of the Garden of

the Gods, a classic Lanai attraction.</LI>

<P>Meanwhile, linked all day long to Manele Bay Hotel by frequent shuttles, is

the highland Lodge at Koele, our vote for the finest hotel we have ever

visited anywhere in the world. Designed like an ultra-elegant English country

manor, or hunting lodge, the Lodge at Koele sets a standard of luxury &amp; serenity

that few lodges ever aspire to match. Nestled in a dense Norfolk pine forest,

surrounded by vast green acres of manicured lawns as lush as U.S. Open

fairways, festooned by countless exotic flower gardens, Koele Lodge has

a Great Hall with vaulted big-beam ceiling, a huge rock fireplace &amp;

antique artifacts gathered from all over the world, conferring tasteful

vitality upon every table, wall &amp; nook you see.</P>



<P>The bedrooms at Koele Lodge offer ample four-poster beds with quilted pillows

&amp; local Hawaiian paintings on the walls. The restaurant meals in the Lodge at Koele

are a gustatory adventure. Every day has a new treat to savor! Adding even

more charm to this vast estate are a swimming pool, hidden little gazebos

where you can slip away for a peaceful tete-a-tete, intriguing sculptures,

&amp; wonderful English Conservatory that's filled with Lanai orchids;

plus a well-groomed putting course, lawn bowling &amp; croquet areas.</P>



<P>For golf mavens, there's the &quot;Experience at Koele&quot; golf course,

designed by champion Greg Norman, with views to four Neighbor Islands from

many fairways &amp; a trademark hole that plummets 200 feet from the tee

to a slyly beckoning green in the valley below. There is Warhol &amp; there

is Cezanne. There is country club golf &amp; there is golf at Manele Bay.</P>

</FONT></FONT></B>All Lanai diving package prices are subject to possible change. 

Unless specifically

noted, these are prices for only the land-based portion of your Lanai dive vacation,

in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. International &amp; domestic

overseas airfares, &amp; commuter (&quot;island-hopper&quot;) airfares

are extra. Nominal U.S. Dive Travel service fees are also extra. 

All U.S. Dive Travel clients who prefer to pay with a credit card will be charged the full

regular retail price, which is five percent (5%) higher than these above-listed

cash discount rates. <BR><BR>


Before we forget, if you have a Lanai honeymoon in mind; well we have honeymoon specials, honeymoon packages, 
honeymoon getaways galore.  We've got Manele Hotel packages, Koele Lodge packages, 
snorkeling vacations, dive vacations for Happy Bubblers, you simply dream of it.  Then Lanai will 
make those wishes into reality.  For a price.  But the price is right, our many satisfied clients will aver. 
Lanai luxury hotels are the crown jewels of Hawaii vacation properties.  Lanai hotels have no peers in the Hawaiian 
Islands, we feel, though some may beg to differ.   
Best of luck with all your dive travel plans! Hope your Lanai dive 

vacation is a great adventure! Blessings.</P>
