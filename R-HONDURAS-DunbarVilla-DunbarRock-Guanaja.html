It's hard to imagine that the spirited owners of this dream resort could improve their already iconic little isle -- but they <i>have</i> !  Wait 'til you see what they've been doing for the last couple years -- it's really something to behold...


<P><b>VILLA on DUNBAR ROCK</b>,  our favorite getaway anywhere in the Caribbean, is poised to raise eyebrows of travel writers & discerning vacation clients around the world.  This inspiring property, reminiscent of luxury island homes in the sunny Greek Aegean Sea, is now bigger & better than ever. The <b>VILLA at DUNBAR ROCK</b> is now made-to-order for large family reunions, corporate retreats, church groups &  medical teams resting after work on the mainland.  <b>VILLA at DUNBAR ROCK</b> also is ideal for dive clubs or dive shop groups seeking an escape from the commercial ho-hum of the Eastern Caribbean.  Here's the gist ...</b>
</p>

<p>After years of hard work & creative design, the mansion on Dunbar Rock in Sandy Bay of Guanaja has evolved from 4 double-occupancy guest rooms to 8 brilliant ocean-side suites, most with private balconies & stunning views for miles along the thriving Guanaja Island reef + one additional guest room.  What was once a $1.7 million home has blossomed into a magnificent $10 million luxury mansion, with 15,000 square feet of roaming room spread across 4 floors -- complete with rooftop bar, private helicopter pad, gorgeous infinity pool & indoor gym.  All of these delightful amenities are perched atop a rock dome, in the middle of a warm shallow clear-water bay, just a quick minute from shore with free 'n easy skiff transfers all day long, whenever you want.  All of this luxury comes with a happy hospitable staff that treats you like family -- yet we're rolling the price back to where it was near the beginning of the Recession.  No fuss, no strings attached.  This special promotion is to thank our many repeat clients for their loyalty, & to celebrate the delightful New VILLA at DUNBAR ROCK.</p>

<p><b>RESORT PRICES: </b> There's normally a minimum group size of 4 adults & a maximum of 18 adult guests.  (Some exceptions may be allowed during select off-peak seasons, on a case-by-case basis; please call for details).  Please also phone us for current prices & summer specials, as prices have been revised by the new owners, & exciting specials may be announced any time... Please remember to add the required Honduran gov't sales tax + SAP-NJA puddle jumper air ticket (we offer group discounts) + nominal tariff per guest. Prices subject to possible change, as always in the Caribbean dive resort realm.</p>  

<b>DUNBAR VILLA</b> owners report that all final fine-tuning refurbs were finished, in style, by spring 2019 -- including a beautiful new infinity pool built right into <b>DUNBAR ROCK's </b>southern side + a new dive shop at water level on the Rock's northern flank + new dockside upgrades + golf cart pathways to take disabled folks up to the first guest-room level from the waterfront.  This luxurious new complex can host diving or snorkeling groups as large as 18 clients (8 premium ocean-view bedrooms each with balcony, 2 guests & a private bathroom, plus one smaller view room downstairs) at <B>DUNBAR ROCK.</b>  As a bonus feature, there are 27 lush garden acres you have free access to stroll & relax in any time you wish, on the main island just 90 seconds away by boat, with about 600 feet of private beach. Check our new yacht photo below.  We also have a large new dive boat + high-tech Nitrox compressor on the way, mateys!<BR> <BR>

Call John or Susan at U.S. DIVE TRAVEL for extra discounts -- such as 1 free resort package for groups of 7+ divers or snorkelers, staying 7 nights or more.  <b><i>Note: New owners recently purchased <b>DUNBAR VILLA</b> & prices will be subject to some very favorable specials for a time.</i></b>  Please feel free to call us any time for more info at &nbsp; <FONT color=#ff0000><b>952-953-4124</b>. </font>  </P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>Ask about our fun, low-cost 3-day tours of the ancient 
Copan Ruins, in the cool mountains of the Honduras mainland near the Guatemala 
border. (See the Copan video hotlink below the "beach dancer" photo on USDT's Home Page!) This lost 
Mayan metropolis is dazzling in complexity &amp; size -- more than a square mile 
of ruins. Copan's architecture &amp; history, the saga of its 17 deity-king 
dynasties, will thrill you. Copan is so magnificent it makes Chichen Itza seem 
like an Old-World parking garage. We were amazed by the almost palpable mystery 
&amp; magic that Copan radiates. To visit Honduras for the first time, yet miss 
a chance to see the Copan Ruins, is not unlike visiting Paris &amp; missing the 
Eiffel Tower or the Champs Elysees. One loses a good share of what the local 
culture is really all about. We consider the Copan Ruins a must-see. Call us 
about a possible Copan side tour, which we can arrange in a jiffy. It's safe 
&amp; economical. </FONT></P>

<B>VILLA on DUNBAR ROCK </B></B></B>is, quite simply, the best vacation lodging on Guanaja Island.  This fact is held as axiom by most Guanaja natives, who love seeing this now world-renowned mansion perching above their Sandy Bay.  Here's why Dunbar Rock has captured the hearts & imaginations of so many good folks over the years.  This fun & affordable watersports center had been the darling of dive pros & travel industry critics since the mid 1990s.  That's when happenstance launched  <B>VILLA at DUNBAR ROCK</B> even more keenly across the radar of tropical vacation clients.  Both of the other top dive resorts on Guanaja went out of business due to escalating fuel costs & market pressures after 9-11.  Yet the happy miracle is this: we remain, steady as she goes, enthusiastically building, refurb'ing, tweaking nuances week after week, refining this Dunbar Rock + Nautilus resort duo into one of the most alluring tropical getaways in the Caribbean.  

<BR><BR>
These beautiful sister resorts on Guanaja Island -- owned by the same friendly Texas family -- are located only about 300 yards from each other, right across Guanaja Island's Sandy Bay, within easy shuttle distance.  The 27-acre plantation + dive shop + waterfront apartments of the old classic (no longer open) <B>NAUTILUS DIVE RESORT</B> are barely a minute away from <B>VILLA on DUNBAR ROCK</B>, by small skiff.  Our water shuttles are convenient, easy as key lime pie, free all day long.  You will feel like nobility out there, smiling VIPs with a staff of private servants to wait on you, serenely ensconced on Dunbar Rock, but  <I>never </I> shut in, never limited in motion, always free as a bird.  You will enjoy easy water-taxi access to virtually anywhere on Guanaja within minutes.  You will feel privileged to work with Senor Denis Midence, arguably the most kind-hearted, savvy scuba diving guide in the Bay Islands of Honduras.  The meals are not fancy, just wholesome, warm, delicious & nutritious. This is Livin' Large, mon, on the smallest of isles.<P>

Not a pixel of hyperbole -- the delightful <B>DUNBAR VILLA</B> is one-of-a-kind.  Over 35+ years of planet wanderings, we have visited hundreds of quality dive resorts & snorkeling vacation properties in 30+ countries & we have never seen anything like this -- anywhere in the world.  A smart Texas real estate developer who owns much of Guanaja's protected southern flanks, the owner has priced <B>VILLA on DUNBAR ROCK</B> & <B></B> dramatically lower than standard Caribbean weekly rates for a choice resort of this 4-star quality.  Hundreds of happy clients have enjoyed Dunbar Villa, & its sister  since it opened.  We are getting constant & consistent feedback from this place.  OK, rewind amigos ... Back story: along with the former owners, a German couple, we pioneered wholesale scuba diving vacations & snorkeling vacations on Guanaja back in 1991, well before the hip & happenin' folks first rambled in around early 1993. <P>

The place has done well. The green of reef preservation has always superceded the long green of revenues.  No Hot Lycra Specials a la Cozumel.  No risible goofball bar scene.  Maybe a couple dozen tourists a week visit Guanaja during peak seasons, & we like it that way.   Guanaja Island's centuries-old Caribbean culture is like Opie & Andy of Mayberry with a twist of lime & shot of dazzling coral.  Nothing's perfect, of course, & sometimes the good ol' boys running those puddle jumper flights will flub the dub in San Pedro Sula.  A few Saturday flights get nixed when they are half-full, not often.  No flights in on Sundays.  However, Mondays & Fridays have given us nearly perfect air connections for years.<P>

Yep, the spirit out here is clean, free of guile, the peoples' hearts are noble, the marine life is precious & vivid.  And we care about those corals & sponges, believe it folks.  We have walked the walk, & 99% of our loyal Guanaja diving clients will agree -- passionately in fact.  <P>

Here's one reason why our clients remain loyal, to us & to Guanaja.  Several years ago, U.S. Dive Travel committed nearly USD $11,000 in wholesale discounts to about 20 student divers, to enable their placement of some 2 dozen permanently anchored buoys alongside the southern reef, for divers & fishermen to use 24 - 7 - 365, to spare the regenerating  reef  from haphazard anchor drops after Hurricane Mitch (October '98).  The Dunbar Villa crew assisted with logistic support & the project was a resounding success, that endures to this day.  We are committed to sharing this Guanaja jewel with the scuba diving & snorkeling communities, in a relaxed, sustainable-yield manner.  This place sells itself by word of mouth -- only.  Friends of friends of friends.  No rampant mass marketing in the dive mags.  Never.  You can't land anything but an twin-engine 18-seater on this island anyway.  And that means good news to the maritime eco-system & the gentle social system as well.<P>

Virtually no crime.  No panhandling.  No dope-peddling, beach-bumming nor tiresome chick-stalking, no room-pilfering of the sort that's plagued Jamaica, the Northern Bahamas, Cozumel & many once lustrous Caribbean island gems.  No e-coli wriggling through the water table, nor heat-packin' Hunduran wiseguys wriggling through local culture, like Roatan has experienced over the years.  The spring water from Guanaja's mountain is as pure as Cascade glacier melt.  Now onward to the corals.  With the new safeguards, there's no diver damage to Guanaja's reefs -- ever.  No thundering hordes of sunscreen-dripping, rum-sipping, coral-snipping tourists -- ever.  No intrinsically sick cruise ships to blight the skyline -- ever.  No cruise ships upchucking skittery camera-toting lemmings who bury the local village alive in pushy pursuit of souvenirs -- ever.  No legions of Jerry Springer wannabes with brassy brattitude, fleeing college for Spring Break sex, drugs & rock'n'roll -- ever.  No spearfishing oafs or hard-drinking hooligans -- ever.  Just down-home cool folks, a few at a time, guys & gals who fly in from San Pedro Sula to dig the sunshine, brilliant reefs, sweet service, lazy hazy days of summer.  Then after an eye-candy day of diving or snorkeling, our clients relish a contented evening up on the breezy balcony with a local barley pop, some conch fritters & a world-class ocean sunset.  All that at a price & value nearly unattainable anywhere else in the Caribbean. <P>

Are we humming your tune yet, amigo?  For well more than 20 years we have poured our hearts into this island of Guanaja.  Given it everything we've got.  Our U.S. Dive Travel admin team developed, refined & perfected scuba diving & snorkeling getaways to this delightful island.  We have vetted these properties to the Nth degree, adjusting services when warranted, responding to customer feedback immediately, serving countless clients -- from celebrities craving escape from the paparazzi, to decent working families seeking the vacation of a lifetime, to honeymoon sweethearts with a yen for inner-space adventure.  Scores of happy customers have written us heart-warming letters of thanks, & they continue to do so month after month.  Check our Client Letter Page, off the Home Page index for Info Kits.  <B>VILLA on DUNBAR ROCK</B> is  a WYSIWYG destination, folks -- What You See Is What You Get.  No strings attached.  The reality <I>is</I> the dream.  No Madison Avenue fluff, no frills, no hassles.  Simple, clean & pure.  Just amazing tropical island fun at affordable rates.  Get down, mon, get down to de basics o' Caribbean Life.  Guanaja Island & <b>DUNBAR VILLA</b> are your oyster.  And U.S. Dive Travel is the spoon.

Historic heart of Guanaja tourism -- the old  home -- built in the late 1800s.<BR>
This venerable home, accented with lovely mahogany, is part of Dunbar Villa's complex.</CENTER>


<BR><BR>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The Dunbar Villa package includes: 
7 nights lodging in a quiet, friendly inn of modest amenities + 5 days of 3-tank 
boat diving + 6th day of 2-tank boat diving (2nd-to-last day) + 3 hearty home-cooked 
meals per day + 1 free night dive per week (weather &amp; currents permitting) + 
round-trip airport transfers on Guanaja (pronounced Gwa-NAH-hah) + all hotel sales 
taxes pre-paid. Tips are optional. All beverages &amp; water-taxi transportation 
for personal side tours are extra costs. The gracious staff at Dunbar Villa / 
Nautilus Dive Resort essentially becomes your private Domestic Dream Team for a 
week. You will have your own personal chefs, maids, gardeners, divemasters &amp; 
boat tenders.  It's been described to us by delighted clients as "having your own staff of personal valets!"
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000> 
The cheerful & optimistic native people of Guanaja are always looking ahead with a strong spirit of positivism &amp; 
dedicated client service.<BR><BR>Second -- Dunbar Villa now has 
a brand-spanking-new guest inn, with spectacular ocean views unique anywhere in 
the Bay Islands, perched atop a 30-foot-high rock pinnacle in the middle of 
Sandy Bay, barely 250 meters from the end of the dock. There are 4 
guest rooms in this beautiful private home, all of which are so close to the 
ocean you literally can fish out off your balcony, if you wish. Now 
Nautilus Dive Resort will be able to accommodate 12-16 guests at a time -- &amp; in 
style despite offering the lowest prices of any reputable dive resort in the Bay 
Islands! Wait until you see this wonderful new villa over the water on Dunbar 
Rock. The owners are calling it "Villa at Dunbar Rock" &amp; it is one of the 
most compelling &amp; unique 3-star lodges anywhere in the western 
Caribbean, we feel.<BR><BR>Because the Honduras Bay Islands got such an unfairly bad 
portrayal by the American TV media in 1999, who exaggerated the extent of 
storm damage considerably, the people of this lovely island are on their toes for 
tourists in a big way. You will never see such an attitude of respectful &amp; 
solicitous service, as the Bay Islands scuba diving community is offering these 
days. They WANT you to be there, &amp; they will bend over backwards to make 
sure you have the best time possible, so that you not only come back some day, 
but you bring friends &amp; family. As far as prices &amp; the attitude of 
classic customer service go, this is the best time to visit the Bay Islands, 
&amp; especially Guanaja, in the last decade.<BR></FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>There's more than Guanaja dive packages to entertain 
visitors here. Among the many rural charms of Guanaja island, there are miles of 
beautiful -- &amp; rugged -- hiking trails within close access of the resort. 
There's a fun, moderately strenuous 3rd-class scramble for a couple hundred 
meters up a rocky buttress to gain the mountain ridge behind Nautilus Dive 
Resort. Then you can hike &amp; bushwhack for miles in near wilderness, with 
thousands of towering Norfolk pines everywhere, &amp; lush jungle below on the 
mountain's flanks. No worries about evil critters here, just bring some bug 
juice. Also bring good Vibram-soled hiking boots &amp; 2 or 3 water 
bottles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>For apres-diving nightlife, there is a small sister 
resort just down the beach on Guanaja, where you can find cold beer &amp; good 
conversations. You can ask the staff to arrange, for small extra fees, a private 
picnic on a pristine deserted cay near Guanaja island, where you can laze or 
romance the day away, far from any human contact if you wish. Guanaja also 
offers outstanding opportunities for deep-sea fishing. Furthermore, some of the 
world's best topwater bone-fishing is right near the Dunbar Villa / Nautilus 
Dive Resort shoreline. (The world-record bonefish was caught off Guanaja, not 
far from Nautilus, just a few years ago.) 's owner was so excited 
he phoned us just to report this amazing catch.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT color=#000000>During the last decade we have 
mastered the art of finding the lowest USA-SAP air ticket prices, plus the best commuter airfares, &amp; perfect 
connecting flights, from San Pedro Sula out to Guanaja island. This is an easy 
hour's flight, maybe a bit more if you stop in La Ceiba on the North Coast. The 
vistas of the unspoiled Honduras North Coast are primo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>This isle of Guanaja is so sweet of spirit, so free of the 
bustle &amp; greed that have sullied many Caribbean islands, that you may be 
changed from the inside out once you visit Guanaja. That's what happened to us 
one Spring. That's why we feel a little twinge of happy envy each time we book 
another couple or family into Nautilus Dive Resort. The resort leaves a subtle 
&amp; healthful mark on your heart. Guanaja is not a place people forget easily, 
we assure you.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>The historic island of Guanaja sits about 40 miles off 
the northern coast of Honduras, maybe 20 miles East of Roatan. Nautilus rooms 
give you sweeping views of an ante-bellum plantation estate, perched 100 meters 
up a gradual hill above the beach. The broad upstairs balcony overlooks miles of 
the blue Caribbean. This comfortable &amp; romantic old mansion has only 6 guest 
rooms -- never a tourist crowd -- &amp; was built by descendants of British 
buccaneers. No kidding, matey.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>First spotted by Columbus in 1502, Guanaja was a haven 
for brawling pirates of the 17th Century, including the infamous Blackbeard, 
Barbarosa &amp; Sir Henry Morgan -- you know, those bearded, growling miscreants 
that Errol Flynn used to swashbuckle over the railing into Davey Jones' Locker. 
Jesting aside, those pirates were painfully real; they lived large on Guanaja; 
they plundered the British &amp; Spanish armadas off &amp; on for about 200 
years, amassing vast fortunes. And they left many sons &amp; daughters among the 
Mayan-African-mixed people of the Bay Islands. Some of their descendants are 
still living in Guanaja's little village cay called Bonacca Town. They are 
beautiful, generous people with sable-cinnamon skin, proper British surnames 
&amp; a singsong "Be Hoppy Mon" accent that will lilt you back to a time in the 
Caribbean when the sextant &amp; the saber were haute technology.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>Guanaja's terrain is fresh &amp; unspoiled, as exotic as 
Tahiti with none of the dross, nor the sullen energies of Papeete. You'll love 
Guanaja for its pristine little cays, coves, mountains &amp; fringing reefs. Yet 
Guanaja has none of the bumbling Bermuda-shorted hordes that invaded &amp; 
infected so many cultures throughout the Caribbean. There are no roads, no 
industrial centers, no high-rises &amp; no pollution on this 7-by-3-mile island. 
The turquoise waters, tall fragrant pines &amp; the trail-rich hillsides are a 
hale hiker's heaven. This is serene, clean Caribbean life like it was more than 
half a century ago. It is a wonder such a place still survives, hard on the 
dawning of the 21st Century. Thank God that Guanaja island is too mountainous to 
build a long landing strip that handles jumbo jets. That fact alone may be why 
Guanaja was spared the cultural ransacking of islands like Hispaniola.

<P><FONT color=#000000>Scuba divers &amp; snorkelers will be delighted to find 
brilliant, unspoiled reefs surrounding nearly all of Guanaja, an ancient island 
near the Southern Belize Barrier Reef. Here some of the Western Caribbean's most 
colorful marine life is thriving, including magnificent hard corals &amp; 
sponges. We've seen tube sponges as tall as a man, &amp; barrel sponges so huge 
a woman could swim down inside one -- except we don't touch one living thing on 
these virgin reefs. We urge our clients to look at, but never fondle, these 
delicate sea creatures. They are candy for the eyes only. So look lots, but 
don't touch, mon. <B><I>Muchas gracias, amigos del mar.</I></B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>The clear Guanaja waters are safe &amp; fun for 
snorkelers &amp; scuba divers all year-round. Ocean temps will likely be 80-84 
degrees F at the surface. The climate is delightful, except in deepest summer, 
when the sun is high &amp; hot, &amp; humidity is also intense. Expect scuba 
"viz" from 80-120 feet! Imagine -- a bad viz day being 80 feet, as you lollygag 
in lapping currents &amp; sea water that's bathtub warm, while a 200-lb grouper 
as mellow as a manatee drifts past you, friendly &amp; unflappable; &amp; large 
green morays sway from their cubbyholes, gaping like curious kids.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT color=#000000>One afternoon, following lunch after your morning dives, 
you can take a water taxi over to the picturesque old-world village of Bonacca. 
This bizarre little hamlet, less than 100 acres, is home to about 3,000 friendly 
Caribbean people. These good folks live in 2- &amp; 3-tiered stilt homes, piled 
atop each other like shoe boxes, flanked by boardwalks &amp; concrete catwalks 
along narrow Venice-like canals that weave through the island. Incessant ocean 
tides sweep through the village day &amp; night. Affable Bonacca Town seems a 
page ripped from some 19th Century schoolbook, yet it even has its own churches, 
hotels, bars, discos, police force &amp; snack kiosks, all hovering over the big 
blue Caribbean! Bring a lot of color film, because Bonacca will get you snappin' 
like Art Wolfe on high-test cappuccino. </FONT></P>Another fun side tour is to 
hike the big peak just behind Nautilus Dive Resort, where after several hours of 
excellent cardio-pump, you'll be treated to one of the best long-distance vistas 
in the Bay Islands of Honduras. If you decide to hike up into the hills, we 
recommend you start very early (by 5 a.m.) to avoid the searing midday sun. Sit 
out the morning dives for sure, before your mountain trek, to increase your 
safety decompression margin. Bring 3 or 4 quarts of water &amp; some snacks, 
plus your camera &amp; plenty of film. Always stay well hydrated in the tropics 
when you're scuba diving. This is vital.
<P></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>Another day, your divemaster guide will speedboat you 
through the island's canal, &amp; around Guanaja to the Northwest side, out to a 
scenic trek up to the island's main waterfalls. Some geologists believe that 
Guanaja, more than 40 miles north of the Honduran coast, is blessed with a 
strange &amp; almost baptismal link to the mainland. The first time we heard 
this story we were astonished by the weird science of it all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>The massive tropical rainfalls that inundate the Honduras 
North Coast &amp; eastern Mosquitia regions have created vast underground lakes 
of fresh water, whose hydraulic pressures over the eons have pushed through 
solid rock strata under the ocean floor -- drilling 40 miles through this ocean 
substratum -- reaching all the way to Guanaja's hillsides! Here, the theory 
goes, that abundant crystal-clear water gushes freely from rock springs much of 
the year, pushed by unimaginable forces all the way from the mainland, then up 
into a mountain's inner depths -- all deeply underground. Even Bill Nye the 
Science Guy might be amazed at this far-out factoid. But we have the waterfall 
photos to prove it !</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>The wealth of water, plus acres of tall timbers back in 
the hills -- perfect girth for ship mast repairs -- were main reasons the old 
pirates favored Guanaja &amp; the Bay Islands. You can still hear some of their 
briny 18th Century lingo in the sing-song slang of the local people. Guanaja is 
an island where not much has changed in half a century.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>Except the tourists. Nearly every person who visits 
Guanaja, &amp; is blessed to experience the quiet excellence of , 
comes away with a refreshed perspective on how good it is to be alive, to be 
young enough to taste the ocean, embrace the cool blue currents &amp; kiss the 
sky, all in a single day; young enough to lay down after a hard day's play in 
the throe of the Bay Islands' sea breezes, that lull you away in a 
minute.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT color=#000000>Then you sleep so deeply that you dream like a child 
dreams, of deep blues &amp; vivid greens, of flashing orange reef fish &amp; 
windy ridgeline sanctuaries, of safe harbors for slow boats &amp; tired souls, 
where stress &amp; anxiety are somebody else's fractured reality, which you can 
laugh at from afar &amp; discard. When you awaken, hummingbirds flitting outside 
your window, a mango tree rustling, a ripe fruit plopping to wet earth, the 
smell of breakfast bread baking in the kitchen -- your dream has not gone away. 
You're still in it, mon. You're on Guanaja &amp; the dream is alive. You are 
living it today. Really living. How long can you afford to stay away from 
Guanaja island?</FONT></P>

<P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT>
<P>All dive package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this 
steadily evolving travel market. Lodging, side tour &amp; diving prices are 
traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets 
are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- 
an industry standard per FAA rules. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect 
you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge 
for more than 24 years now. Remember please, the federal 
government has deregulated all U.S.-based airlines, so only they control their 
pricing -- not any travel professionals. Early is good when seeking the best air 
ticket rates.</P>
<P>Unless specifically noted, these above scuba diving packages are prices for 
only the land-based portion of the resort, in all cases reflecting 
double-occupancy rooms.   International air tickets &amp; 
commuter "island-hopper" seats are always extra above these land costs. Nominal 
service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the vessel + side tour 
components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $55 per person for the 
land portion + $35 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive 
slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. 
Solo clients will always pay a single supplement to secure a private room -- 
normally USD $377 more than the standard double-occupancy rate at Dunbar Villa</P>

<P>Remember, all tropical vacation clients to Guanaja island will be charged about USD $15 for a 
"reef preservation fee", assessed by municipal officials right as you deplane at NJA Airport.  Also, you will be 
asked by Honduran emigration officials at SAP, upon departing the airport on your final day, 
to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $35 - $40 per 
client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down 
there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final 
moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no 
fuss; &amp; away you go. Best of luck with your dive travel plans. We hope your 
scuba diving vacation is a safe &amp; satisfying adventure. Blessings &amp; best 
wishes with ALL your Honduras dive vacations.</P>
<P>Best fishes too!</P>
