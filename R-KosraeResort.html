When you say the word Kosrae, it almost escapes your lips like a lick
of summer seawind, or a lover's whisper in your ear.&nbsp; Those who know
Micronesia well, such as our computer wizard Robert, who has been there
several times, will aver that Kosrae's name is poetically apropos.&nbsp;
That's because Kosrae is renowned for its amazingly clean &amp; healthy
reefs, its unspoiled jungles, &amp; its vast &amp; mysterious mangrove
thickets, like eerie labyrinths, with beautiful jungle trees jutting up
from clear marshes.&nbsp; These are special wetlands that are just brimming
with vivid eco-systems.  The eco-tourism here only enhances the magic of our dive tours.

<P>Transportation is one big factor behind the magic of Kosrae.&nbsp; It's
challenging enough to get to Kosrae that it's unlikely ever to become another
ho-hum glitzy little tourist island.&nbsp; The cost of air tickets &amp;
the good long day's distance from the West Coast, with an overnight in
Guam normally, tend to weed out the madding crowds.&nbsp; But Kosrae is
close enough via normal air routes to allow you reasonable access with
no excrutiating hassles.&nbsp; That's a perfectly happy balance when it
comes to the adventure "feel" of a place, we have learned over the years.

<P>Continental's Air Micronesia lands its small jets on Kosrae five days
a week.&nbsp;&nbsp; And this is no godforsaken backwater.&nbsp; It's a
place well removed from city stress, but also just enough into the 20th
Century to feel comfortable to most dive travelers.&nbsp; The local people
are well educated &amp; most speak really decent English.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's
also a tradition that most local folks treat visitors as honored guests.&nbsp;
And this part of the Kosrae ethos lends a special flavor to your vacation
that's ineffable, &amp; money cannot buy such a fine feeling.

<P>Kosrae Village Resort is definitely a place where you can enjoy modern
amenities (indoor plumbing, hot water, electricity) in a traditional Micronesian
cultural setting.&nbsp; So no worries about some platoon of 8-inch quivering
Mama Cucarachas sneaking in on you at night to haul you bodily from your
bed.&nbsp; This lovely resort is a gem among Micronesia resorts; 
it's lean, clean, serene &amp; keen on hospitality.

<P>If you are the sort of adventure traveler who tunes in, with enthusiasm,
to ancient stone ruins (almost like the Stonehenge of Micronesia), plus
World War II remnants, rainforest &amp; mangrove ecology, butterfly &amp;
bird watching, snorkeling trips or scuba diving, then this is an island that
has your name written all over it.  Kosrae diving is a treat not be underestimated, 
despite the lack of dive magazine puffery about this magical island.
In fact, Kosrae diving beats a lot of more heavily promoted islands.  In fact, Kosrae 
diving stands a good chance of becoming one of the hottest scuba tickets in 
Micronesia over the next several years.  Think you have done all the dive tours that matter, amigo del mar? 
Give Kosrae diving a whirl & you will be gratified to the core.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>WHERE in the WORLD is KOSRAE, YOU MIGHT ASK?</FONT></B>
<BR></FONT>
Located in the Federated States of Micronesia, an island group in the
Pacific
Ocean, Kosrae is east of Palau, Southeast of Guam & west
of the Marshall Islands.
Kosrae is a fairly mountainous island, blanketed with verdant jungle
&amp; girdled by a spectacular fringing coral reef. Kosrae is known for
some gorgeous sand beaches, untrampled dive spots, acutely colorful flowers
&amp; a warm hospitality to strangers. Kosrae is one of the last genuinely
unspoiled islands in the Pacific.  Whether you are a snorkeler or scuba diver, or just 
a weary traveler seeking Pacific solace & sunshine, Kosrae is a solid bet for 
tropical vacation value.  Snorkeling & scuba diving are not all you will find here on 
sleepy, friendly Kosrae, however.  There's another quaint & compelling aspect to 
Micronesia vacations & Micronesia resorts, built in the Old World manner.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>KOSRAE VILLAGE RESORT is BUILT in</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>the CLASSIC OLD MICRONESIAN WAY.</FONT></B>

</font>
<BR>Traditionally speaking, the construction of a Kosraen lohm or family
home begins by plunging four huge corner posts six feet or more into the
soil. These anchoring posts give the house its exceptional strength in
winds &amp; rains. As additional framing is added the entire structure
is bound solidly by tough coconut fiber twine woven in complex knots around
these bedrock timbers. The floor is raised above the ground to permit the
easy flow of cool sea breezes, in a sort of natural air conditioning. The
peak of the steeply pitched thatch roof is normally about 20 feet off the
ground, easily shedding rain &amp; encouraging these cooling air currents
to flow freely.&nbsp; Most of the roomy individual bungalows at Kosrae
Village Resort are built in this traditional style.&nbsp; And this is a
big part of why the "feel" of this place is comfortably, &amp; exotically,
Old World.

<P>The floors are raised above the ground, the walls are constructed of
locally woven reed siding, &amp; the thatch roof raises to a steep pitch
about 20 feet above the ground, resort literature notes. Timbers are wrapped
&amp; tied throughout the bungalow, from the spacious porch to the large
bathroom &amp; garden shower. The techniques work just as well now as they
did nearly half a millenium ago!

<P>Although the look is traditional &amp; construction a fun Old World
style at Kosrae Village Resort, modern amenities have been tastefully installed
for visitors' comfort. These extra touches include queen beds (draped in
mosquito netting to keep any buzzing bugs at bay), ceiling fans, electricity,
hot &amp; cold running water, a large table, chairs, in-room refrigerator
&amp; a coffee pot.&nbsp; At any time, the resort staff is glad to exchange
the queen beds for three twin beds, &amp; to install a work table for die-hard
videographers or photographers.

<P>Kosrae Village Resort offers bungalows built under the shade of mangrove,
pandanus &amp; coconut trees at the ocean's edge.&nbsp; These bungalows
are interconnected by paths of naturally hard-packed ocean sand. Strategically
situated lamps provide night lighting along the paths.&nbsp; The resort
owners are proud to report in their literature, as well, that each &amp;
every building, every bathroom, every door, everything in this place is
100% easily accessible to disabled persons. What this translates to is,
of course, roomier rooms &amp; easier access for everybody. Every resort
entrance or exit is ramped (starting with the parking area), with resting
platforms where appropriate.  Despite what some guidebooks may say about the 
smaller isles of this region, Micronesia vacations need not be gritty Third World 
experiences.  Kosrae's prime dive resort is a good example.

<B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></B>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The SCUBA ENVIRONMENT is "To DIVE FOR!"</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>One of Kosrae's glowing natural jewels is her famous fringing reef.&nbsp;
Locals often say that, "we have only one dive site, &amp; it's 43 miles
around!"&nbsp; The abundance of marine life &amp; pristine hard corals
make this a destination for divers everywhere, who fear they already have
seen &amp; done it all. Many of Kosrae's best sites offer mellow currents
&amp; are ideal for newbie divers.&nbsp; However, the watchful divemasters
observe, you still need to have excellent buoyancy skills, so that Kosrae's
nearly virgin corals remain that way for many decades to come!  Kosrae diving has 
not been Cancun-ified yet, & Lord willin; it never will be.

<P>This ringing reef of Kosrae is a great democratizer for dive groups
of varying abilities, in that beginners can relish an easy scuba or snorkeling
experience, while their more grizzled veteran comrades can tackle harder
deeper dives with a plethora of visual delights &amp; physical challenges.&nbsp;
The dive operation is called Sleeping Lady Divers, &amp; is a full-fledged
Five Star PADI dive center.&nbsp;&nbsp; This well-run dive shop recently
expanded the in-house repair department.&nbsp; It is now an authorized
repair center for respected industry brands such as ScubaPro, Aqualung,
Mares, Zeagel, SeaQuest, Sherwood, Uwatec &amp; Atomic.&nbsp;&nbsp; So,
no worries mate.&nbsp; You can rest assured that if something breaks down
on the gear you tote out to Kosrae, or jostles out of adjustment, the local
lads can fix it for you &amp; help you maintain your gear warranty properly.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>KOSRAE CARES for its CORALS with ECO-T.L.C.</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>Kosrae Village Resort owners emphasize that they were pretty proud
when Mr. Moses Macwelung, Governor of Kosrae State, openly praised the
ongoing Coral Monitoring Project, as well as KVR, in his State of the State
address in the fall of '98.&nbsp; There is expected to be another coral
monitoring team, which will visit Kosrae Feb. 13 - 25, 1999. "This is a
tremendous opportunity to visit the island, meet the people &amp; experience
the culture as well as contribute to the well being of Kosrae &amp; the
planet. - To say nothing of the extraordinary diving!" resort owners say
in their literature.&nbsp; The dive operation here on Kosrae is super-particular
about preserving the healthy marine life &amp; corals that have been native
to these islands for centuries.&nbsp; Their kid-gloves approach is to be
commended, &amp; contrasted with other Micronesian cultures in past decades
that cared little about their reefs, &amp; ran roughshod over them.&nbsp;
Not HERE!&nbsp; Kosrae reefs are in beautiful shape.  They are, indeed, one of the 
prime draws in Micronesia diving, for the adventuring sort of traveler.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>HERE ARE SOME CLASSIC KOSRAE DIVE SITES --</FONT></B>
</font>
<P><B>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
SHARK ISLAND:</B></FONT>
<BR>This is a great wall dive where the top of the reef sits at 40 to 70
feet. Potentially strong currents on this dive make it a scuba adventure
for experienced divers only.&nbsp; This site also may pose balance &amp;
control challenges for underwater photographers bent on the perfect pause
for that decisive moment.&nbsp; Common scuba critter sightings include
sharks of many species, big barreling barracuda, eagle rays, Napoleon wrasse,
dog-tooth tunas, rainbow runners, happy sea turtles &amp; scads of smaller
tropical fish. This particular site is also home sweet home to many forms
of healthy crinoids, lobsters &amp; other marine invertebrates.

<P><B>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
WALUNG CORAL SHELF &amp; GARDENS:</B>
</FONT></font>
<BR>Steep wildly sloping walls are the watchwords here, amigos del mar!&nbsp;
Over the edge of the big wall you can catch glimpses of prowling sharks
&amp; the other hefty ocean- going denizens.&nbsp; However, the really
special magic on this dive is on the top of the reef at 40-60 feet. You
will enjoy some exceptional aggregates of hard corals, plus scads of other
colorful life-forms: tropical fish, darting &amp; cavorting shrimp, flitting
octopi.&nbsp; The fact there's very forgiving currents makes this an ideal
dive for photo nuts &amp; a good dive for novice divers as well, the local
divemasters say.

<P><B>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
WALUNG DROP-OFF:</B>
</FONT>
<BR>Kosrae diving has its thrills too, funseekers.  
Here you can veer along a sheer wall underwater that often offers some
mighty fast currents. Resident schools of barracuda, meaty jacks &amp;
assorted rainbow runners are often joined by spotted eagle rays, napoleon
wrasse, turtles &amp; other good-sized pelagic critters. The reef top here
is just as magically alive -- with color &amp; abundant species -- as the
Coral Gardens are.

<P><B>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
HIROSHI POINT:</B>
</FONT>
<BR>Easy beach entry makes this an excellent dive for all levels, the divemasters
say. This has been tagged a world-class snorkeling locale, as well as an
easy certification site for new divers. The top of the reef is painted
liberally with very large hard corals everywhere, most of which are within
20 feet of the surface, &amp; scattered randomly among sandy patches. Large
schools of burly parrotfish, majestic flying eagle rays, &amp; many many
varieties of rainbow-hued tropical fish mean that this locale is also a
great spot for night dives, when weather &amp; currents oblige.  Whether you're a 
snorkeler or scuba diver, you'll have access to these brilliant underwater vistas.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>BRIEF HISTORY NUGGETS:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>Kosrae Village Resort literature notes that the island of Kosrae was
originally populated by people sailing ocean-going canoes from several
other parts of the Pacific region.&nbsp; By the time the first Europeans
landed on Kosrae in 1824, the descendants of these early settlers had evolved
into a colorful &amp; complex feudal society.&nbsp; The Kosrae King &amp;
his royal court lived in Lelu, a small island linked to the main island
by a hand-made rocky causeway. Lelu was primarily man-made &amp; surrounded
by high walls built from volcanic basalt. Today the remnants of these walls
are one of the archaeological wonders of the Pacific.

<P>The Kosraen people for centuries have been renowned for the quality
of the enduring &amp; comfortable fabrics they weave from banana fibers.
Today many excellent weavers carry on this age-old tradition.&nbsp; You
can hike quietly around the island any afternoon &amp; see these craftswomen
weaving hats, mats, baskets &amp; wall decorations from sword plant leaves
(pandanus), coconut, hibiscus &amp; other island fibers.

<P>Missionaries from New England arrived on Kosrae (via outposts they had
established on the Hawaiian Islands) back in the year 1852.&nbsp; Then
gradually over a period of many years, these persistently perky preachers
managed to convert most of the Kosrae people to Christianity. Now, Kosrae
ranks among the most devout &amp; conservative of the many Micronesian
islands. Kosrae also is famous for its splendid choral singing,&nbsp; which
developed as a church-worship spinoff from the early days of Christianity.&nbsp;
Today these devout &amp; peaceful Micronesian people lead their quotidian
lives in nearly the same fashion as their ancestors did for hundreds of
productive years. Many Kosrae natives continue to prepare natural meals
from the land &amp; the sea, build rugged homes of island plant products,
as well as farm, fish &amp; carve dugout canoes with traditional kinds
of tools, just as their forefathers (&amp; foremothers) did for many centuries
of peaceful island living.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>AIR TRANSPORTATION LINKS:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>Continental Air Micronesia serves Kosrae Monday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday &amp; Saturday from Hawaii &amp; Guam.&nbsp; Kosrae departure tax
is about $20-$25 US.&nbsp; Taxes vary with time, of course, &amp; are subject
to possible change.<B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></B>

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>NO CURRENCY EXCHANGE PROBLEMS:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>U.S. currency is the way to go here on Kosrae. There are two commercial
banks on the island of Kosrae: The Bank of the FSM, &amp; the Bank of Hawaii.&nbsp;
Kosrae Village Resort always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard. Cash &amp;
travelers checks are recommended for
<BR>stores &amp; small businesses on Kosrae (moreso than plastic).

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>LANGUAGE IS ALSO NO PROBLEM:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>Kosraen is the local language but most people also speak English, &amp;
are happy to engage you in English about anything you wish to address.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>RENTAL CARS &amp; TAXIS:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>Taxis service &amp; car rentals can be arranged easily &amp; economically
through Kosrae Village Resort.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>TELE-COMMUNICATIONS:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>International telephone, Fax &amp; Internet services also are available
for your convenience. FSM Telecommunications office is open 24 hours a
day, in case some personal or work emergency should beckon, while you're
escaping on Kosrae.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>ELECTRICAL POWER SYSTEM:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>The power here is standard 110 volts with U.S.-style outlets (2 flat
prongs).

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>SHOPPING OPPORTUNITIES:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>Several types of well-stocked stores on the island offer a variety
of goods. The Kosrae Village Resort gift shop offers locally made handicrafts,
souvenir T-shirts &amp; other items. If you have a special interest in
crafts, let us know &amp; we will set up visits with local artists, who
come to the hotel to share their wares &amp; dicker gently with you.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>SUNDAYS ARE DAYS of R &amp; R --</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&amp; THOSE ARE CAPITAL "Rs" on KOSRAE !</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>There are several Christian religions thriving on the island, &amp;
Congregationalist are the most widespread of these. The classical Kosrae
Sunday church service offers an intimate glimpse of inner Kosraen life
&amp; visitors are always warmly welcomed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sunday is still
observed as a traditional day of rest, just like it was a century ago in
rural areas of the U.S. &amp; Canada.&nbsp; Therefore stores &amp; most
businesses are flat-out closed to honor the Lord's Day.&nbsp; It's good
to keep this tradition in mind, since you won't find any K-Marts or Wal-Marts
or mini-marts anywhere on Kosrae, especially on Sundays.&nbsp; The lazy
haze of summer days imbues the Sundays on Kosrae, &amp; most folks who
visit really relish this relaxation opportunity a great deal.

<P>However, despite the Sunday rule, the Inum Restaurant at Kosrae Village
Resort is open 7a.m. to 9 p.m. every Sunday.&nbsp; Hey, a guy's gotta eat,
right?&nbsp; All kidding aside, here are some important Sunday recommendations
from the Kosrae Village Resort management, to make sure you don't inadvertently
step on any sensitive local toes, in this sweetly conservative Old World
culture:
<UL>
<LI>
Men should always wear long pants &amp; a shirt.&nbsp; Swim trunks &amp;
ratty T shirts in town are not at all cool.&nbsp; The rest of the week,
anything reasonable goes, knock yourself out; but on Sundays the locals
like a gent to be gent.&nbsp; No worries, no ties or wingtips needed, lads!</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Without exception, women of all ages should always wear a dress or skirt
with no bare shoulders &amp; no bare thighs please.&nbsp; Bare female flesh
on Sunday is to Kosrae as bare baby bottoms would be on a sushi counter
in downtown Tokyo.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
Two critically important Sunday laws hold sway on Kosrae:&nbsp; The first
is this -- there is absolutely no fishing or harvesting of any marine life.&nbsp;
It is good to respect this &amp; all the local laws, since folks here are
so mellow &amp; seldom pushy about anything.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The second law is this -- please remember there's no consumption of alcoholic
beverages allowed on Sunday.&nbsp; One day in seven free of the evening
bump won't kill anybody, right?  Scuba diving vacations are not a "license to ill" 
in another culture, as the kids would say nowadays.</LI>
</UL>

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A DARN GOOD LITTLE RESTAURANT:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>The Inum Restaurant has a regional reputation as one of the best eateries
in all of Micronesia.&nbsp; The chefs there specialize in local &amp; international
dishes.&nbsp; Their dinner menu changes nightly, depending on the availability
of fresh local produce, chicken &amp; fish. In addition to fine meals &amp;
top-flight service, the restaurant is a focal point for various community
activities such as the cultural night on Thursdays, plus the ever-lively
Monday night movies.&nbsp; Both of these shindigs are open to the public
at no cost. Usually, a couple times each month a local band or two will
be invited to play on a Saturday night, so the high school kids, &amp;
the young at heart, can shake a leg to a little soft-touch island rock.&nbsp;
You'll not hear Alice in Chains nor Marilyn Manson covers over here!

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>GROUPS LIKE KOSRAE for CONFERENCES:</FONT></B>
</font>
<BR>Kosrae Village Resort is becoming a popular venue for small professional
conferences &amp; workshops, such as the two-week eco-tourism workshop
that was held in the summer of 1997. The Inum Restaurant's large dining
room is easily subdivided to set up dedicated conference space, leaving
a small dining room available to the public.

<FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>KOSRAE VILLAGE RESORT WINS ECO-AWARD:</FONT></B>

<BR>The proprietors of Kosrae Village Resort say they are quite proud of
the Environmental Award that KVR recently received from the PATA (Pacific
Asia Travel Association) Micronesia Chapter during the quarterly membership
meeting held this September on Kosrae.&nbsp;   Few scuba diving resorts 
ever receive kudos of this kind.  This award recognizes that
in addition to being built &amp; operated in an ecologically friendly way,
KVR provides major support for the mooring buoy &amp; coral monitoring
projects as well as a number of smaller projects benefiting Kosrae.

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT>

<P>All dive package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging, side tour & diving prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard per FAA rules. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; & that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our tropical vacation experts normally secure excellent wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated all U.S.-based airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals.  Early is good when seeking the best air ticket rates.</P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above scuba diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At many dive resorts, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International air tickets & commuter "island-hopper" seats are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets & the vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $35 per person for the land portion + $20 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. Solo clients will always pay a single supplement to secure a private room -- normally 35% to 50% more than the standard double-occupancy rate at some dive resorts.</P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for all of our dive resorts, side tours & air ticket specials is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer only. No personal checks or credit cards will be accepted for the land portion of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest & our prices the lowest in this industry, & thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa & Mastercard. For ultra-discount wholesale air tickets, USDT accepts only cashier's checks or wire transfers, please.</P>

<P>Remember, all tropical vacation clients to all foreign destinations will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $25 - $40 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; & away you go. Best of luck with your dive travel plans. We hope your scuba diving vacation is a safe & satisfying adventure. Blessings & best wishes with ALL your dive vacations.</P>

<P>Best fishes too!</P>
