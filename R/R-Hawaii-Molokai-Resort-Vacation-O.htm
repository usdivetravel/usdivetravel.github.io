</B><P>Over on Oahu island 40 ocean miles to the west, there's an ol' joke they like to tell about Molokai, which says it all about this friendly Hawaiian island.  &nbsp; Take a typical traffic jam in Honolulu -- thousands of drivers backed up west of town on the sweltering H1 freeway, gritting teeth, all progress clogged from the Airport eastward to the Pali Highway.  <I>Scene shift.</I>  Now there are two local guys in pickup trucks side by side, elbows out the window, talkin' story on a gravel road east of Murphey's Beach.  Sipping sodas, happily oblivious, they are blocking the one-laner entirely.  That's a traffic jam on Molokai!  And only a clueless mainland tourist would ever honk. The locals merely crack a smile & shine it on.  Life's too short.  <I>What-evah....</I> </P>

<P>But beneath this laid-back island ethos, something special's about to happen here.</P>

<P>At long last, the shy little isle of Molokai is opening up soon for scuba diving vacations. The island is gearing up for visitors as never before -- ready to welcome enthusiasts of mountain biking, ocean kayaking, highland trekking, &amp; good ol' beach basking, too.  So we are feeling stoked, funseekers, after waiting 10 years for this moment!  Molokai is so rarely visited by North American tourists, we sense a watershed moment here for serious snorkelers &amp; scuba divers, who like us are searching for something fresh, sweet-spirited &amp; untrampled, a little wild &amp; yet still comfy.  Visually compelling, spiritually vitalizing, emotionally healing.  That's what we call a <I>"Tropidelic" </I>Hawaii vacation!
</P>

<P>If you feel you've already evolved into The Jaded Travel Guru --  <I>"Bendar Dundat"</I> -- hold that thought, amigo.  Think you've seen it all with Hawaii scuba diving vacations or Hawaii resorts?  Really believe you've sampled every classic Hawaii snorkeling beach already?  If you think there's nothing new under the sun in Hawaii vacation packages, please think again friend.  You've overlooked a Hawaiian treasure; in fact we all have.</P>

<P>The magical mystery island of Molokai is like a ripe fruit ready to plop off the Tree of Life, right into your lap.  It's yours for the picking, but only if you fly to Hawaii with an open mind & a sunny disposition.  Hard-boiled hearts will not be at home here on Molokai, nor will urban stress junkies, nor loud & rowdy party people.  A Molokai vacation is more of a spirit-cleansing getaway than a garden-variety Hawaii resort trip.  No show-biz <I>  a la   </I>wacky Waikiki -- not on Molokai.  No barely smiling Honolulu college girls in half-shell-coconut bras dancing imitation hula for blotto tourists at some crowded luau.  No shirtless dudes with oiled pectoralis majors twirling fire batons.  No comics telling the same stale Portugee jokes twice a night to a couple hundred mainlanders in loud aloha shirts that no local boy would ever be caught dead wearing.  </P>

<P>Molokai is the real McCoy.  Here you'll find the soul of Old Hawaii with all the comforts of a New Century.  Pretty tricky line to tread these days.  Pacific islands like Molokai are rare as 10-carat emeralds in a world that airlines &amp; the Internet are shrinking daily. Then there's the safety matter. For a jittery post-911 America, Molokai is a secure tropical escape from worries about &nbsp; <I>you-know-who</I> &nbsp;  doing &nbsp;   <I>you-know-what </I> &nbsp; to innocent tourists in planes, pubs &amp; pizzerias. Few islands we have enjoyed in the Mid-Pacific can match this meld of safety, serenity, laid-back locals &amp; eco-exotica.</P>
<P>Now you can enjoy adventure sports &amp; easy eco-tours from sea kayaking to mountain biking, clifftop nature treks &amp; 3D archery, body surfing &amp; whale watching, all on one lush 30-mile-long Polynesian isle. Molokai is the island for "twenty-something" adventurers of all ages -- shameless kids like us who refuse to grow brittle in middle age.  We've got something fun for everyone:  high-rev cardio tests for the serious trekkers, divers & mountain bikers; or medium-caj adventures for folks who want to rough it in comfort.  We've designed soul-stirring vacations that are a little off the wall &amp; well off the beaten path.   You get to rest in 4-star luxury at Sheraton Molokai Lodge up the hill, or in posh "tentalows" at Kaupoa Beach Camp, then by day explore the scores of peaks, valleys & jungle byways of this magnificent little isle.  Check our extensive list of tropical eco-adventures, village cultural tours, scuba diving & back country sports -- in hot-linked section 2 here below -- all available on this alluring Hawaiian island of Molokai. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>SO HOW do we MARKET a WEDGE of HEAVEN,<BR>
WITHOUT GIVING MOLOKAI one WHOPPING WEDGIE in the PROCESS?<BR>
</B></FONT>Big moral dilemma. How does one market an unexploited tropical island like Molokai, without becoming part of the very force we oppose in eco-tourism -- some dollar-driven exploiter of an old world culture, wearing the guise of Beneficent Uncle Green the Savior of Indigenous Peoples Everywhere? We wrestled with this ethical issue for years &amp; then the moment came. Almost as if by happy accident.  It's simply time. Several city fathers spoke warmly with us, the hotel people invited us over with a big smile, even hugs. The islanders treated us like <I>ohana kama'aina</I> -- family members born on the land. What can we say, every island has its day.  Molokai is poised to enjoy its day in the sun; we can feel it coming, folks...</P>
<P>Now you have our plan. It is a clean & simple plan.  We want to sell eco-tourism packages, with lodging in resorts on Molokai -- the Sheraton Molokai Lodge & the Kaupoa Beach Camp.  We want to bring snorkelers, scuba divers & eco rovers over.  We hope to do so soon, perhaps as early as Spring 2008. The people of Molokai have told us they are ready to welcome you, the scuba diving &  snorkeling mavens, the mountain bikers, kayakers, beachcombers &amp; hardy hikers too.</P>
<P>But if you're a Big City businessman, bent on hauling in three charter planes a month of hard-drinking tail-chasing table pounders, we will politely decline. If you're a boatload of speargun hunters flying out for a few days of drilling reef fish, &amp; bagging bugs, we will again decline, but less politely. </P>
<P>If, on the other hand, you're young honeymooners, or a middle-aged couple on your 20th anniversary romp, or a family with "show-me-the-excitement-dude" teens, maybe an extended family on a big reunion, even 2 dozen dive club buddies from Seattle, or a corporate incentive team from snowbound Chicago who are desperate for sun &amp; blue sky, then we will certainly say <I>aloha nui loa</I>, welcome to Molokai diving, welcome to Molokai eco-tours.</P>
<P>C'mon over &amp; make yourselves at home.  </P>

</I><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P><B>MEET TIM FORSBERG, the FUTURE of MOLOKAI DIVING:<BR>
</B></FONT>"Molokai is like the Bubble Boy," says islander Tim Forsberg with a winsome grin. "There's a dome over this island &amp; the rest of the world goes by. If you don't want traffic &amp; you just want to chill for a few days, then Molokai is your place." Tim is a fellow Minnesota native, hailing from our hometown in fact, who just moved to the island to pursue his adventure dream. He has re-opened the old-time fishing &amp; dive shop &amp; locals like him a lot. Kaunakakai village was buzzing with new possibilities when we visited this summer. You can feel a keener energy in the stores &amp; cafes.  There's something healthy going on here in Tim's scuba & snorkeling shop on Molokai.</P>
<P>Susan &amp; I like the cut of this gentleman's jib. Tim Forsberg recently advised some predatory fish collectors they could hang it on their beaks when they approached him to procure Molokai scuba diving support. Their money-making scheme was to slip in under the grapevine radar, scoop up thousands of tiny tropical fish from the virgin Molokai reefs to stock city aquariums, then sail off before anyone caught on. They offered to pay some long green.  "No thank you," Tim declared. "If I turn this shop into a monster, the locals will not support me. It's not my intent to become a bazillionaire." Nor a fish pimp, thank you.</P>
<I><P>Good thinkin' braddah, you one stand-up guy.</P>
</I><P>Tim Forsberg is a solid chap, driven by customer service, a sense of community.  He will be our new eco-tourism &amp; scuba diving partner on Molokai. His staff at the Kaunakakai dive shop will grow eventually to a dozen Molokai scuba diving &amp; eco-tour guides who will cater to your wildest yens, virtually anything healthful you can dream up with your clothes on. Here is what our new adventure travel team will be offering -- a trove of Molokai eco-tours we feel has potential to match the highland joys of Costa Rica or Belize eco-tours:</P>

Many are descendents of original 19th century patients, all of whom were cured completely decades ago. Only mules, serious hiking or a small charter plane can get you down that cliff to Kalaupapa.

This is one of the most remote wilderness basins in the Pacific. <B>Halawa Valley</B> is half a mile wide, more than 3 miles deep &amp; leads to two breathtaking waterfalls that effervesce the pool below so powerfully, local folks say it feels like diving into sparkling soda bubbles!

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>The SIREN SONG of MOLOKAI LURES US BACK.<BR>
</B></FONT>Susan &amp; I have kept a keen eye on this island since our first trip in the fall of 1993, waiting for the right moment to invite our preferred clients to Molokai. Now the time has come. Let me put this simply, the way an ancient Hawaiian would have done, just before letting 'er rip with a trumpet tone from an old conch shell. </P>
<B><I><P>"<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Molokai no ka oi</FONT>!</B></I>" (Translation: Molokai is the finest.) </P>
<P>We are convinced after all these years that this slogan is fact. Molokai island is so tranquil &amp; gracious in its ethos, that reverence for elders &amp; gentleness toward "<I>keiki</I>" (kids) are a way of life here. For decades the tradition on Molokai has been for all residents to address any older local woman as "Auntie" &amp; any older local man as "Uncle." Now, how would that fly in South Beach, Orange County or Manhattan? No matter how deeply the hip-hopped hot-lipped MTV-fueled culture erodes goodwill between teens &amp; parents on the mainland, Molokai will always abound in Aunties, Uncles &amp; coddled kids. The virtues of respect, workaday civility &amp; good humor are alive & thriving here. </P>



<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>NO NEED to BRING your CITY STRESS ALONG.<BR>
LOCAL FOLKS will CURE what AILS YOU:<BR>
</B></FONT>There's something in the collective unconscious of Molokai that inspires emotional flexibility &amp; humility, that prompts locals to "adjust" any visitor who arrives putting on airs. It's kind of a tribal instinct, unwritten, a gentle social pressure to get real, get down with the neighborhood. A hauty attitude is just not cricket on Molokai. The locals will condition that <I>out </I>of a visitor -- but quick. It's a hoot to see how discerning islanders are to nuances of speech &amp; gesture, &amp; how subtle they can be when they nudge some visitors to mellow out &amp; live a little.</P>
<P>Here's one example we enjoyed on our latest trip. As they drape the traditional flowered lei over your shoulders when you first arrive, a centuries-old greeting of Hawaiian island affection, many local folks will watch carefully how your eyes engage the moment -- if at all -- &amp; whether your smile is stilted or delighted. Your expression as you receive this act of <I>Aloha</I> reveals a lot about you. A blush or averted gaze, in a humble way, will light them up like a lamp of hospitality. Vulnerable eyes spark friendship &amp; trust; stiffness brings a wary response from the local folks.</P>
<P>"When they get their leis, if that makes them twitch, then we're OK," says the lovely Krisha Sahagun, 25, assistant front desk manager at the Sheraton Molokai Lodge, an exceptional luxury resort in the Molokai highlands overlooking the Pacific, where most of our guests will be staying.  We call Krisha the "Go-to Gal" of the Sheraton Molokai Lodge, as her alacrity &amp; good cheer are amazing.  Pretty much the same thing with all the staff we met at this classic big-wooden-beamed Molokai Ranch hotel.  The wide  open landscape everywhere -- Big Sky Country in Hawaii, with ranch hills rolling 10 miles gently down to the sea -- this everpresent vista seems to have opened the hearts &amp; minds of nearly everyone we met at the Molokai Ranch hotel.</P>

<P>Another warm memory of the Aloha Spirit we have seen on Molokai.  One afternoon we were driving back from the island's remote east end, maybe 25 miles east of the main town a couple hours before sundown, & two high school kids were jogging down the middle of the gravel road, training for their cross-country team it seems.  Their Mom followed in her car, maybe 60 feet behind, running interference on that one-lane road so nobody would mow down her young'uns on a blind curve.  We found ourselves in a short queue of cars trundling down that road, westward toward Kaunakakai village, barely 10 mph for 15 minutes, waiting for a wide spot in the road to pass.  We turned on the radio, chilled back with some slack key guitar, munched on trail mix -- & who cares?  The imminent sunset promised to be vivid, the air was warm & redolent of salt spray, the ocean less than 100 meters to the left, shushing endlessly, "take it easy, take it easy."  Nobody honked, nobody worried.  What the hey.  We could have driven a hour that way in an evening reverie.  If you can appreciate  that scenario, then Molokai is the place for you.  If not, no worries, there are other isles, & miles to go before you sleep....</P><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P><B>HAWAIIAN 101 -- TALKIN' da kine MOLOKAI WAY:</B><BR>
</B></FONT>Krisha Sahagun, the go-to gal at Sheraton Molokai Lodge, is a spirited young mother with a steeltrap mind &amp; the blood of the Neighbor Islands in her, who could charm a coconut tree to shed its fruit in one happy bump. I told her we expect she'll be running for Congress some day.  She's the sort of admin professional who reminds you of Radar on the old MASH show, who seems to anticipate your thoughts or wishes before you even articulate them.  Krisha  was a joy to work with, as were her staffers from the domestics to the front desk.  Molokai Lodge employees are proud of their hotel & it shows in a life-positive attitude.  But that's about the only attitude you'll see around this place.  Same goes for the easygoing & helpful staffers of the Kaupoa Beach Camp, down on the waterfront of Molokai's remote western shores.  Uncle Donald Dudoit, the camp manager & hostess Auntie Mapuana made us feel as if we were relatives visiting from the mainland, & their hospitality was genial yet relaxed, intelligent, ready to help, not obtrusive in the manner of an imperious French waiter.  These island people carry a life-positive energy that's charming, refreshing & as much a part of the Molokai experience as the beautiful landscapes that surround them every day.</P>

<P>"We do not understand <I>hai maka-maka haoles</I>," Krisha Sahagun told me one afternoon, as we toured the grounds of the Sheraton Molokai Lodge.  She spoke softly. "We are all pretty laid-back here. Look, my car is parked outside with the door unlocked &amp; the key in the ignition."   Krisha wasn't kidding one bit, folks.  We checked on the way back to our room.  Her keys  <I>were </I>  in the ignition all right.  How would that play in Peoria?  Or LA, or NYC for that matter?</P>

<P>"Ya shure, Sven n' Ole, if only vee could live dat vay in fussy ol' Norsky Minneapolis, ya know...."</P>

<P>OK, westward we go, back across the Big Blue Pacific.  Another peek at Molokai's special culture.  It's time for Hawaiian Pidgin 101. Molokai has the smoothest Pidgin English dialect of all the Neighbor Islands in Hawaii -- almost a lilting rhythm to it. "<I>Haoles</I>" are white folks, usually from the mainland, though locals have longtime friends among the <I>"kama'aina haoles" </I> or Caucasians born & raised on the islands.  "<I>Kama'aina</I>" translates literally to mean "born of the land."  Then there's a phrase used, at times when needed, wherever Molokai Pidgin speakers congregate -- "<I>hai maka-maka</I>" -- which means class-conscious or snobbish. The ancient Hawaiian culture always encouraged a relaxed, unpuffy style of chitchat, so this is one delightful legacy of old Polynesia that remains in force on Molokai. Few <I>hai maka makas</I> ever come to Molokai, &amp; those who do wander in, hey they get healed in a wink. Then they get the knack of <I>mana ohana</I> (the family spirit) &amp; people everywhere will give them cheerful <I>kokua</I> (a helping hand). The two words you must take home with you above all are the classics of <I>aloha </I>(a feel-good hello or good-bye) &amp; <I>mahalo</I> (thank you!). I love listening to those happy Hawaiian cadences, spawned in the sugar cane fields more than a century ago by haoles mixing with Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos &amp; pureblood native Hawaiians.  They fashioned a jerry-built dialect, borrowing phrases & accents from each of their homeland tongues, mainly built on the foundation of native Hawaiian, & the outcome was a delightful hodge-podge of cultures that proves the flexibility & resourcefulness of human beings in a pinch.</P>
<P>That's Molokai. Pure &amp; simple. A meld of many good things, & many good people.</P><BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>TRAFFIC?  WHAT TRAFFIC ?<BR>
</B></FONT>Even after decades of cars &amp; trucks tooling about, this island still has not a single traffic light. Not one! Many of the stop signs on Molokai simply recommend that you "Whoa." The local cops are friendly young gents who might give you a break if your attitude is clean. <I>"Now please do NOT exceed the speed limit again, sir. We are counting on your cooperation."</I> You see, nowhere on the island of Molokai is there a posted speed limit above 45 mph. Never has been. Not much for these gentleman gendarmes to do.</P>
<P>No international airport here on Molokai, no bumptious shopping malls, &amp; no itchy Atlantic City moguls, poised like barbarians at the beachhead, begging to build some grand casino complex to soil the seascape. Nuts to that noise!</P>
<P>All you will find is miles of virgin windswept beaches, trackless as some uncharted Polynesian atoll, plus the most copious schools of fish per cove we have seen anywhere in the Mid-Pacific. Big pelagics, even 30-lb trevally &amp; honking monster jacks, who for some goofy reason swim close to shore in certain seasons near the close of day, when normally in Hawaii you would find them in much cooler deeper waters. It's a mystery to us, this Molokai diving phenomenon, &amp; we have free-dived or scuba dived every island in the Hawaiian chain, from Niihau to the Big Island (except the old ordnance target of Kaho'olawe) countless times since 1990. Never saw anything like this before.  Might be the monk seals were spooking those huge pelagic fish to hug the shoreline near dusk? Might be a confluence of winds, currents & baitfish migrations?  Maybe those large fish were hunting for something tasty in the shallows? Who knows?  But they're not supposed to be that close to shore, normally.  It's a fascinating quirk of Nature. That's Molokai diving for you.  And Molokai snorkeling is just as riveting a watersport.  Just learn to hold your breath a couple minutes.  The lung burn is well worth it.</P>

</B><P><B>(2) </B>There's also the new <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">KAUPOA BEACH CAMP</B></FONT>, unique in the Pacific -- a cushy tent-bungalow village on the wild west end of the island. There are 40 neatly built "tentalows" &amp; they are 100% comfortable, clean, right near the two pocket cove beaches. These sturdy high-walled canvas bungalows, stretched over aluminum frames, are built atop spacious wooden platforms with a bathroom, huge hotwater shower &amp; a private deck. The showers &amp; toilets are super-clean &amp; solar powered, designed impeccably for minimal impact on the earth. Big healthy wild turkeys strut the grounds like they own the place, &amp; rare Hawaiian monk seals flop around happily all over the beaches, wherever they feel like planting their blubber. This is stylish tropical camping, amigos, &amp; perfect for families with kids, big church groups, or a passel of dive shop buddies from Michigan. It's a cool new take on 21st century camping. We had an absolute blast at the Kaupoa Beach Camp & we recommend it especially for big family groups, churches, synangogues, informal company getaways.  This is unlike any beahc camping we have done anywhere in the world -- so easy you almost feel guilty calling it "camping."</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>BACK to  ECO-TOURISM BASICS:  MOLOKAI DIVING<BR>
&amp; MOLOKAI ADVENTURE SPORTS are READY to ROLL -- FINALLY !<BR>
</B></FONT>Here's how we came to this moment of sharing something we never thought would happen. We had decided 10 years ago never to tell anybody but our family &amp; old friends about Molokai, almost warily guarding the name of it. Finally, after a decade of local controversy about cruise ships threatening to stop by in & denature Molokai, plus jitters about land developments & countless locals fretting about tourist traffic, there were some random phone calls, countless checks on the Web, piles of e-mails, more calls to city fathers then something started to bloom like a tiger lily on a summer day. </P>
<P>We stopped over on Molokai as part of this summer's Hawaii contract tour '03. Best move we ever made. Now we estimate, based on scores of candid conversations, that well more than three quarters of the islanders want to see some tourists come &amp; enjoy, according to city fathers &amp; country mothers with whom we talked. Merchants, fishermen, the articulate newspaper editor, plus everyday citizens whom we interviewed on a recent trip this summer; they all seem to agree that Molokai's moment has come. </P>
<P>Why now?  Perhaps the post-911 economy knocked some new reality home. Perhaps people who for years swore they would keep their mother island free of mainlanders, are dismayed at the steady exodus of young adults leaving Molokai after high school to seek their fortunes among city lights. Perhaps they feel that taking a measured initiative now, putting their foot down in a firm manner, will keep the latter-day lumber barons out later on. Kind of like overseeding your lawn with fine Kentucky Blue keeps the crabgrass down next spring.</P>
<P>Molokai is opening its arms to tourists as never before. But you can see subliminal worry wrinkled into the foreheads of many Molokai residents. This is subtle, kind of bittersweet, the way a Mom looks at her son as he boards his bus for college, the first time away from home.</P>





<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>ENTER the BIG IDEA: an OLDIE but GOODIE --<BR>
SUSTAINABLE YIELD ECO-TOURISM in HAWAII.<BR>
</B></FONT>Mom's expression in mind, here's the gist of a Molokai vacation.  Wilderness preservationists (yep, the fingers typing this piece belong to one) have bandied a pet phrase since the 1980s -- "<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">sustainable yield farming</B></FONT>." That conceptual link to island preservation has been gnawing away for years on our  collective unconscious at U.S. Dive Travel.  Why the heck not  <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> <B>"sustainable yield tourism"</B>  </font> in Hawaii, we have wondered for years?  Is it ethically sound or just a manipulative tool to tap the big Green market out there, to pitch a PC buzz word to the Marin County, Boulder & Seattle sets?</P>
<P>We had been worried that by marketing Molokai, we would be flirting with defacement of a unique resource for oafish economic gain. Face it, any time we welcome tourists to a place as sacred &amp; vulnerable as Molokai, we are helping locals "farm" the very essence of their island. Farm it &amp; sell it to outsiders. But there's one heck of a difference between organic truck farming &amp; strip mining one's own native soil, the people of Molokai Hawaii agree with us. </P>
<P>We're not going to hug our trees so jealously they wither, topple & die.  Hey, all things in moderation -- including moderation!</P>
<P>In more than 3 decades of helping good people plan adventure travel to more than 30 tropical countries, we have learned how to sell without selling out. It's not an easy moral tightrope. But it's do-able, it's fun &amp; it makes our clients happy. So we do it, year after exciting year of growth, pausing frequently for a reality check to make sure the sales momentum has not drifted into avarice.  You do the gut checks often enough & the paychecks come OK.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT LOW-IMPACT TOURISM.</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><BR>
</B></FONT>U.S. Dive Travel has turned away scores of resort &amp; vessel operations since 1991 who came to us with get-rich-quick schemes, or who demonstrated indifference to reef preservation, or whose divemasters were so inept they belonged in a special-ed class for Ocean Bozos. We encourage the kind of visitors who take away nothing but mac nuts or coffee beans &amp; leave behind nothing but jotted addresses with new island friends. </P>
<P>(Let's pass on that doe-eyed cliche' about "footprints in the sand.")  Oh, BTW, If you guys are late with your deposit, we'll make you rake your own footprints behind you, everywhere, especially on the magnificent miles of Papohaku Beach.  <B>;)</P>
</B><P>Low-impact tourism -- it's like opening a few Canadian Rocky trails 2 years after the big fire, or letting a few hearty souls shuffle up Mt. St. Helens 4 years after the Big Boom, or a handful of new climbing parties each year up the pristine ridges of K2.  Low-impact tourism is NOT the Nepali government approving dozens of Everest permits each year, creating a cattle route so climbers can discard scores of metal O2 tanks on the South Col -- world's highest junkyard.  Low-impact tourism is NOT cruise ships chundering thousands of plaid-clad lemmings a year onto the pier at Cozumel.  Good grief.  It's clear now that the island of Molokai -- despite an impassioned minority of well-meaning Luddites in the opposition camp -- desires tourism in a healthy way.  Like we all do, these good people need to feed their kids in the wake of the worst recession we all have weathered in decades. </P>
<P>Therefore we are espousing a method of tourism that affords this island the profound respect it deserves. It's all about balance. And we know how to do this right on Molokai. We have done it right on islands all over the Pacific &amp; Caribbean for years. Took us a decade to figure Molokai out. Once the people of Molokai embraced the idea of sustainable yield tourism this summer, we felt encouraged &amp; ready to rock. If you had any idea how psyched we are feeling ....</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">CAN YOU BELIEVE this ECO-TREAT ?<BR>
HAWAIIAN MONK SEALS by the DOZENS !<BR>
</B></FONT>There's another key facet to a Molokai diving or Molokai eco-vacation -- the wilderness delights. One of the rarest marine mammals in the Pacific is the sleek &amp; powerful Hawaiian monk seal, an endangered specie that local Hawaiians protect as if they were family. There are only a few hundred of them still left in the ocean wilderness, yet scores of these monk seals visit the southern shores of Molokai each summer. It's like some angelic visitation. </P>
<P>Mind you, the law requires you to keep your distance &amp; observe the seals through lenses, or from a higher perch where you cannot hassle them. We did so, religously, &amp; we recommend you also follow that rule, even though there's no stentorian Seal Cops lurking in the weeds to nail you. It's the right thing to do, to cut those gentle critters a little slack, when their gene pool is half empty.  On this last trip we tried so hard not to intrude upon any seal's zone of comfort, but in one remote pocket cove, we were free diving one afternoon & in a blink one large juvenile monk seal swam right up behind me, poked his head out of the water quizzically & startled the daylights out of me.  He was hardly afraid & seemed prime for play, though I probably just scared some lunchable fish his way.  I felt as lucky as that biologist, years ago in Africa, who first had a silverback mountain gorilla sidle up to her & touch her gently with one finger.  My pulse was pounding for a good 10 minutes.  Complete unmitigated joy!</P>
<P>Friends, it's tough to suppress hyperbole when you experience something like this.  But on Molokai these events are commonplace.  One moment like this creates a memory that lasts a lifetime.  It's a soul-stirring event to gaze upon a Hawaiian monk seal pup, just as we did for hours on a remote beach one afternoon last summer, knowing he is as rare &amp; majestic within his realm as a Siberian tiger is on the Asian steppes.  By the way, these animals can grow bigger than a sumo wrestler.  Even a Hawaiian monk seal pup tips the Toledos at more than most men could ever bench-press.</P>  

<P>Oh yeah, livin' large on Molokai!</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>DARE WE SAY.... "OUR" ISLAND of MOLOKAI?<BR>
</B></FONT><I>Our</I> beautiful island of Molokai is like an etching on the back of our retina -- &amp; I say "<I>our </I>beautiful island" by dint of the 10-year long-distance love affair we have carried on with this island, not by any landed-gentry rights. Susan &amp; I have no rights here. Only dreams &amp; aspirations.  The way the morning & evening light washes the waterfront & the hillsides of Molokai, is something so exquisitely beautiful -- any day that is not storming, that this light almost imprints an archetypal image, like some dream landscape, that you recall scores of times at random moments later in your life, when you are away on trips, at home, at work.  That's the closest thing to magic that most of us are capable of experiencing, anywhere on this noisy planet.</P>
<P>In our opinion, after in-depth visits &amp; photo forays to most of the accessible sectors of this island, even the highest peak of Kamakou Mt. (4,961 feet), Molokai is the most relaxed, least touristy, eco-purest island in Hawaii. What's more, Molokai is home to the friendliest Aloha Spirit, &amp; the warmest hospitality we have experienced in the greater Hawaiian chain. Plus there are many secret spots like geographic treasures, just waiting to be found by the cardio-hearty adventurer. But folks, there are some locations we will never talk about.  Ever. That would be like gossiping about your own wedding night.</P>
<P>Now for the issue of the beautiful Neighbor Islands of Hawaii. Like parents making sure each kid gets exactly the same size piece of cake, hey, we love you too Oahu, Maui, Kauai &amp; the Big Island! We will be sending plenty of good folks your way, too.   <I> Don' worry, be happy!   </I>Each Hawaiian  Island is blessed with distinctive charms &amp; its own inimitable flavor. But these more populated isles are moving way more headlong into the 21st Century than Molokai. There's something different in the air on Molokai, something ineffable, compelling. We cannot wait to go back. Even after visiting a couple dozen countries, &amp; spending several cumulative years overseas since the 1970s, this place has a mind-bending Siren's song all its own.</P>
<P>We want to hear it again soon, smell the salt air, feel the Norfolk pine needles underfoot on the high mountain trails. The shorelines of the southern side are eye candy, the mists over Kalaupapa are brain candy, the sunset glow on the fields east of Kaunakakai is soul candy. And like the song says, "I like Candy!"  So....go do the island, be the kid, rely on your eye &amp; open your lid!</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>MORE of the MAGIC of MOLOKAI, a GALLERY of LIVING ART:<BR>
</B></FONT>We've found remarkably warm pure waters all around Molokai. When the winds are not whipping -- as they sometimes do from the north &amp; west in summer, blasting sand off the beaches in gritty billows -- these shores &amp; coves are perfect for snorkeling, free diving &amp; scuba diving. There are more than 28 miles of fringing reef just south of the island, most of which is one step away from turn-of-the-20th-century virgin. Very little damage to any of the reefs; they are vivid, glorious, alive with critters, seething with color everywhere you turn. Molokai diving &amp; Molokai snorkeling sites are still being charted, &amp; are just a short step away from the virgin years of past decades.  No reef is 100% virginal anymore in the Pacific, but this is as close as it gets in the real world.</P>
<P>There are vast verdant hillsides on Molokai like a slice of Ireland, that glow with an almost surreal vividness just before dusk, as the bronze sunset illuminates some deep green chlorophyll in their acres of ancient grasses.  We have seen this phenomenon only twice before -- on one northern island in Tonga, & again in a pasture in southern Ontario -- nowhere else in the world quite as keen a green as this. You will see photos here on this page, unretouched, straight from our astonished eyes. What on earth is causing this vibrant glow?  Any botanists out there with a clue?  Give us a jingle, we'd love to hear from you.</P>
<P>Moving along to the northern rim of Molokai, you will find the tallest seacliffs in the world -- the North Shore Pali -- jutting nearly 3,900 feet above the Kalaupapa Peninsula, where the legendary Father Damien labored to care for the hapless, then hopeless victims of Hansen's Disease in another century.   This peninsula is one of the most visually amazing &amp; mysterious places in all of Hawaii. It's impossible to resist the urge to descend that cliff &amp; walk quietly through the village with your formal escort. There's an air of utter peace &amp; holiness there, like the Spirit of Creation still dwells in every palm tree &amp; stretch of gleaming white sand. Remember the old Star Gate TV show? I used to muse that when that sleepy gray fog creeps across Kalaupapa some mornings, maybe this flat peninsula, jutting into the perfect ocean like some mammoth pingpong paddle under the seacliffs, is really the portal to another universe --  a tropical Star Gate.</P>
<P>But here's what I like the best about a Molokai vacation. There are easygoing people everywhere you turn, ready with a smile, who make you feel like you were born there.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff">WHY DID WE WAIT so LONG to SPILL the BEANS on MOLOKAI?<BR>
</B></FONT>"So why are you guys springing this story just now?" we've been asked. Fair question.  Here's the gist, sunseekers. We waited 10 years to write this piece about Molokai vacations for three key reasons:</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>First reason</B></FONT>, the scuba diving infrastructure was non-existent until the fall season of 2003. There used to be only one way to beg or borrow a scuba diving tank.  He was a kindly ol' local fellow down in Kaunakakai village with a compressor in his backyard, some rusty tanks &amp; a big heart, but no formal PADI instructor experience. He's a native Hawaiian, fascinating to talk to, but a bit wary of tourist influx.  In fact, this local gent admitted to me several years ago, at a meeting over at Aloha Stadium on Oahu, that he wasn't that thrilled about bringing mainland divers out, anyway. So we stayed out of his way......&amp; we waited for the Molokai vacation moment to crest.  Now, a new outfit has moved into Kaunakakai from our hometown of Minneapolis -- run by the bright &amp; witty Tim Forsberg -- &amp; within months they will have a professionally proper scuba diving center in place, ready to roll. Tim already has air tanks &amp; a good compressor, &amp; he sells dive gear in his fishing store down in the village. A fine new boat is on the way before Spring 2008, he estimates. </P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Second reason</B></FONT> -- our own little private anxiety. We fretted about selling out, becoming establishmentarians, the very capitalist porkers my generation used to warn our parents about in the late 1960s &amp; '70s. Basically, we worried about becoming the new  Eddie Haskels of adventure travel.  "What a fine morning, Mrs. Cleaver!  Would you care to join Wallace & me for a little eco-tourism?"  No worries on this score, finally.  Most of the local folks we interviewed are ready to welcome mainland tourists, as long as we come in on little cat feet, like the Kalaupapa fog. </P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Third reason</B></FONT> -- Back in the '80s & '90s, a number of Molokai vacation hotels were in dismaying flux, in &amp; out of business, up &amp; down with prices, all over the map on customer service.  What's more, the local economy was wheezing like a geezer. Most of these challenges have been addressed by able hands & some serious capital investment.  Talented chefs & managers have been brought in, rooms upgraded to the Nth degree. What the Sheraton people are doing with Molokai Lodge & the Kaupoa Beach Camp is creatively cool, while keeping a keen eye tuned to ecology issues.  The Molokai economy is healing.  Village elders are opening their hearts & minds.  Aunties & Uncles are starting to wonder about their next mainland guests.  The times they are a'changin.'  Molokai vacations are an emerging reality -- today.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>HOW our LOVE AFFAIR with HAWAIIANA STARTED:<BR>
</B></FONT>By way of background, we were born &amp; bred to love Hawaii &amp; now it's part of our marrow. My lovely wife Susan grew up in the Hawaiian Islands for more than 20 years, &amp; we still have scores of family &amp; friends on many of the Neighbor Islands. Since our first Hawaii honeymoon in 1990, Susan &amp; I have been blessed to visit the Hawaiian Islands 16 times for a total of 55 weeks of diving, hiking, body surfing &amp; photo shoots -- most often with our two little boys in tow -- Jack &amp; Bo. BTW: we take our Hawaii honeymoon clients quite seriously too, remembering  how our own first Hawaii vacation goaded us to quit our buttoned-down corporate jobs right after we returned.  We invested the golden parachutes we got, on a wing &amp; a prayer -- &amp; there you have it -- U.S. Dive Travel's origin. But we digress....</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>COMPARING MOLOKAI to OTHER BRILLIANT TROPICAL ISLAND GEMS:<BR>
</B></FONT>Molokai ranks among the few genuinely unsullied isles we have stumbled across throughout the Pacific in 33 years of adventure travel: well on a par with the remote Northeastern Fijian Islands, or the northern Ha'apai &amp; Vava'u jewels of Tonga, or the wild &amp; lonely Loyalty Islands of New Caledonia, even the little nameless motus girdling Northern Sulawesi in Indonesia. The feeling you get from drinking in the sights &amp; smells of Molokai, the purity of the people &amp; the landscape, is something that many islands in the Caribbean -- &amp; we mean Roatan, Cozumel, Cancun, Jamaica, the near-northern Bahamas for example -- all lost years ago. Irretrievably, some say. </P>
<P>One cannot a re-virginize an island that's already been had.</P>
<P>There IS a point after which one can love a place to death. It's like the scientist poking a pond organism under a microscope. That tiny rotifer wriggles this way &amp; that, struggling to survive, but pretty soon it's a stiff lump of ex-life, studied to death by the very force that hoped to unlock its mysteries.  We are talking about purity of purpose, purity of the land, of the waters, &amp; purity of people's hearts. It's in short supply in this ditzy dollar-driven world. But not on a Molokai diving or Molokai snorkeling vacation.</P><BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT LOW-IMPACT TOURISM.</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><BR>
</B></FONT>U.S. Dive Travel has turned away scores of resort &amp; vessel operations since 1991 who came to us with get-rich-quick schemes, or who demonstrated indifference to reef preservation, or whose divemasters were so inept they belonged in a special-ed class for Ocean Bozos. We encourage the kind of visitors who take away nothing but mac nuts or coffee beans &amp; leave behind nothing but jotted addresses with new island friends. </P>
<P>(Forget that cloying doe-eyed cliche' about "footprints in the sand.")  Oh, BTW, If you guys are late with your deposit, we'll make you rake your own footprints behind you, everywhere, especially on the magnificent miles of Papohaku Beach.  <B>;)</P>
</B><P>Low-impact tourism -- it's like opening a few Canadian Rocky trails 2 years after the big fire, or letting a few hearty souls shuffle up Mt. St. Helens 4 years after the Big Boom, or a handful of new climbing parties each year up the pristine ridges of K2.  Low-impact tourism is NOT the Nepali government approving dozens of Everest permits each year, creating a cattle route so climbers can discard scores of metal O2 tanks on the South Col -- world's highest junkyard.  Low-impact tourism is NOT cruise ships chundering thousands of thirsty lemmings a year onto the pier at Cozumel.  Good grief.  It's clear now that the island of Molokai -- despite an impassioned minority of well-meaning Luddites in the opposition camp -- desires tourism in a healthy way.  Like we all do, these good people need to feed their kids in the wake of the worst recession we all have weathered in decades. </P>
<P>Therefore we are espousing a method of tourism that affords this island the profound respect it deserves. It's all about balance. And we know how to do this right on Molokai. We have done it right on islands all over the Pacific &amp; Caribbean for years. Took us a decade to figure Molokai out. Once the people of Molokai embraced the idea of sustainable yield tourism this summer, we felt encouraged &amp; ready to rock. If you had any idea how psyched we are feeling ....</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IT'S MORE LIKE the "NATION of MOLOKAI" --<BR>
</FONT><I>"<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Molokai no ka oi</FONT>!</B></I>" Yes the finest.  We like to imagine Molokai to be only nominally a part of Maui County. That's just some paper-pushers' political label.  Molokai is to Maui as Grandma's lemonade is to Gatorade, as Amish sulkies are to rumbling red   Humvees. The locals are so calm &amp; self-sufficient, their dialect &amp; accent even stand apart from the Neighbor Islands of Hawaii. Molokai people remain unruffled by matters on the mainland, resolutely holding onto old Hawaiian traditions. It's almost as if life here has been frozen in the Fifties, &amp; people are living not next door to Maui, but in the independent "Nation of Molokai." </P>
<P>Look, if dozens of Native American tribes get to call their casino-driven reservation an Indian Nation, then by jiminy what these Hawaiians have is "The Nation of Molokai." For reasons of spirit, reasons far deeper than rum &amp; roulette wheels.</P>
<P>This place  <I>feels</I>  like a foreign country &amp; yet it's a bona fide corner of the USA only 6+ hours travel time from LAX, including layovers &amp; puddle jumper. What more could one ask for in the fidgety world apres' Sept. 11, 2001? Now, for once, what seems to be hype to the jaded world traveler is just plain true. This is what Susie &amp; I feel -- this island <I>is</I> the jewel of the Hawaiian chain. Nothing is perfect, of course, no person &amp; no place. </P>
<P>Molokai has its share of lost souls on ice, car prowls &amp; disenfranchised local youth. There's a fair bit of unemployment, a few hundred sorry-looking acres here &amp; there where you'll see soil runoff or old grassfire scars. You've got your rusty pickups &amp; guys with backwards baseball caps barreling down back roads with a Smokey & the Bandit mission & transmission.  Yet a new "<I>mana ohana</I>" -- a spirit of familial warmth, is rising across the island, like some fresh wind off the heart of the blue Pacific.</P>
<P>However, here's the rub. Please tell only the folks you trust the best, but do not tell too many.  You'll hear that sort of softly twitching cognitive dissonance all over Molokai if you open your ears &amp; mind. It's an emotional tug of war. OK, bring in the tourists,  maybe not too many, maybe not for too long.  It's a balance that they, &amp; we, are seeking....nothing easy to explain, mates. Everything beautiful we know in the Pacific is layered with complexity &amp; a little mystery. That is the way of the Big Blue Yonder. And we like it that way.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>WHO NEEDS AROMA THERAPY or DOUBLE MARTINIS?<BR>
</B></FONT>If there were more escape islands like Molokai, to flee to for a few days of refreshment, then this world of urban sleep deprivation, cold meals on the fly, soccer moms &amp; hockey dads driving kids around like crazed chauffeurs on a caffeine jag, madding crowds in the malls &amp; cafes, lippy underwear-over-the beltline teens sassing anybody over 25, TV smutfests &amp; grinding politics in the cubicle farms of America -- this world would be far less volatile, far kinder. If most of us could have just 7 nights on an island like Molokai even once every couple years -- we are convinced the mental health, productivity &amp; civility of North Americans &amp; Europeans would improve by quantum leaps. </P>
<P>Who needs daffy aroma swatches to relax, or lux-therapy boxes, or exorbitant shrinks with one eyeball glued to the clock? Who needs the idiot fog of weed or hard liquor to alleviate this 21st Century Mega-Stress that is crushing the spirits of our friends in Japan, Australia, North America &amp; Europe? Who needs that New Age balderdash of dangling crystals, or "aum-aum-ing" under pyramids or zombie-ing out in isolation tanks? Those cures can be worse than the illness.</P>
<P>Folks, here's how it really works.  We are only allowed to  <I>have </I> Molokai in two ways. When we're there -- we have the island for a brief moment in time. When we're not -- we have the pure idea of it.  For as long as we want.  When things fall apart &amp; the center cannot hold in your nitty gritty urban life, Molokai is a fine place to find your center. If mere anarchy is being loosed within your world, as is has been loosed many times in ours, then feel free to give us a call.  We feel your need, too, all the time. Lord knows we have been blessed with perhaps the best jobs in the world, but even too much work & too little play can turn a Hessburg into a Stressburg!  And there's never enough play time around here at Rez Central.</P>


<P>You could spend a month on Molokai, & barely see the half of it.  For such a relatively small island, it's verdant hillsides, countless pocket coves, sweeping beaches & deep jungle valleys are reminiscent of the Green Mansions type of vistas you might see in the Tahiti Island group.  So many places to see, so many wonderful people to meet, so little time.  Oh, before we forget, just remember to duck when you're walking around the Ancient Phallic Rock, high atop the North Shore cliffs on Molokai, or you might get beaned by a granite Johnson big enough to flatten a mini-van.  Now wouldn't that make for some fine family video?  Must have made their husbands feel like Richard the Lion-Hearted, but for centuries before the Missionaries came, young women on Molokai who had trouble conceiving would sleep overnight atop this Phallic Rock, under the superstition it would help get them pregnant right away.  Think they were deluded?  Get this, funseekers.....</P>
<P>The first time we visited Molokai 10 years ago, I cautioned Susie in jest not to, er, embrace the ancient totem, as we were still relishing wedded bliss sans kiddie noises & dripping noses.  In the widescreen movie of life, my sweetheart wanted a PG rating, big time, while I was edging towards the concept, taking, um, well, baby steps.  So of course the Sooz Meister defiantly touched yon Phallic Rock with a fingertip & -- boom -- a few months later there was Baby Jack, growing away like a Hawaiian gourd.  Cause & effect?  Hhhmmmm.....only the Shadow knows.   Perhaps the whole joyous Molokai island vibe had more to do with that happy bit o' tropical fertility!  So now that you know the facts, & the fantasy of the Ancient Phallic Rock atop Molokai's northern cliffside, you either can slap that granite or give it a wide berth -- so to speak.</P>

<P>Are you beginning to see why so many scores of people are hoping that Molokai will never, ever go the way of Negril or Roatan, Cancun, Cozumel or Cabo? Not if we can help it, friends. Not if the wonderful residents of Molokai Island can help it.  <I>You just watch 'em, braddah.</I>  They know what side their bread is buttered on.  And God bless them for that, over there, across the Big Blue in the beautiful green "Nation of Molokai."</P>

</I><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT NOTE about MOLOKAI RESORT PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:<BR>
</B></FONT>All Molokai vacation package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this evolving travel market. Molokai hotel prices are likely to remain stable, while Hawaii air ticket prices may fluctuate until the date of payment. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- a longtime airline industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge for more than 12 years now. We normally secure excellent discount Hawaii air tickets. Remember please, the federal government has deregulated all US-based airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any mainland travel professionals. But our Molokai hotels &amp; Molokai diving contracts are set for one year at a time, &amp; therefore are rock solid year after year.</P>
<P>Unless specifically noted, these above Molokai vacation packages are prices for only the land-based portion of your Molokai diving vacation, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. Commuter "island-hopper" airfares from Honolulu are always extra above these land costs -- about $100 - $130 per client depending on season & package. Nominal service fees are also extra for Hawaii air tickets &amp; the Hawaii lodging + Hawaii diving components. The baseline tariffs for all Hawaii diving clients start at $35 per person for the land portion + $25 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving. No Molokai eco-tours will be booked for solo scuba diving or solo trekking clients, only for couples, duos, or groups -- unless a solo client chooses to pay a single supplement equal to 2 adventure-touring clients.</P>
<P>The preferred payment mode for all Molokai lodging, Molokai diving &amp; Molokai tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay only via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for the Molokai resort portion of any Molokai vacation reservation, please. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest &amp; our prices the lowest in this industry, &amp; thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin, since bank merchant service fees skyrocketed after 911. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard, happily. </P>
<P>One final afterthough about the phrase "Leper Colony," which for decades was used to describe the hospice work of Father Damien.   Most folks who use these terms --  leper colony, Kalaupapa Leper Colony, Hansen's Disease -- in conjunction with Molokai island, mean well but have little knowledge of the social impact of such wording.  When you say  leper colony, Kalaupapa Leper Colony, Hansen's Disease, be cautious, please, so as not offend any islanders.  Not one person on that island today suffers from any active case of leprosy, so ZERO WORRIES!  There is no active Molokai leper colony any longer, only a sleepy village where some of the children & grandchildren of original patients still dwell in peace.  Therefore, the terms  Molokai leper colony, Kalaupapa Leper Colony, Hansen's Disease are loaded & should be used with sensitivity.  Remember,  Molokai leper colony, Kalaupapa Leper Colony, Hansen's Disease, speak these words with TLC, please.  There is no active leper colony anywhere on Molokai.  The illness has been eradicated for all time by simple powerful antibiotics.  The Molokai leper colony is only a dim memory, & a tribute to a saintly Father Damien & his heroic work.</P>
<P>Best of luck with your Molokai hotel or Molokai resort plans. We hope your Molokai vacation is a safe &amp; satisfying adventure. Blessings &amp; best wishes.</P>
<P>Best fishes too!</P>
