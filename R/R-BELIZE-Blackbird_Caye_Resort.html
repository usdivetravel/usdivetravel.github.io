By all objective criteria, acknowledged by dive pros worldwide, this is the best-value luxury scuba diving &amp; snorkeling resort on the Belize Barrier Reef -- second-longest living reef in the world. This sector of Belizian sea is also <I> the only place</I>  in the Atlantic or Caribbean where you will find classic coral atolls, similar to atolls of the South Pacific.  There are only three atoll systems in Belize, & Turneffe Atoll is far & away the most environmentally brilliant & diverse of them.  What's more, our agents' many visits to Belize since 1992 confirm that Blackbird Caye is the pearl of Turneffe Atoll's best resorts -- in price, value, service & reef quality. <BR>

<P> 

Atolls are sunken rims of huge ancient volcanoes that slowly wore down below sea level, around which beautiful rings of islands formed over ensuing centuries.  In each of these three Belizian mega-atolls, the extinct volcanic caldera (bowl at the top) has formed a sandy bottom, shallow & gentle in most locales, & lush with colorful corals.  There are scores of brightly-hued fish species everywhere.  These Belize atolls are alive with sleek mantas & eagle rays, assorted skates, trumpetfish, coy little 'cudas, spectacular rainbow reef fish & the occasionally surprising dolphin pods, too.  While not as kaleidoscopically brilliant as the reefs of Fiji or Papua New Guinea, the atoll life forms of the Belize Barrier Reef are worthy of a close silver medal.  When you factor in that your air ticket from the USA, Canada or Europe is about half to one-third the cost of flying to Fiji or PNG -- then Belize is a superior bargain -- offering the choicest corals & marine life you will find anywhere in the Caribbean.  Fully on a par with Little Cayman's Bloody Bay Wall & the outer pristine islands of the Turks & Caicos chain, Belize is as good as it gets in this hemisphere,  <I> amigos del mar.</I>  We are confident these Belize snorkeling trips & Belize scuba diving vacations will be a "C.P.B" for all our job-stressed city folks out there -- that is, a <B>Calm Palm Balm</B> to soothe your soul.    So welcome funseekers, sunseekers & sundry ocean-lovers, you are entering a <B>Tropidelic No-Hassle Zone</B> for singles, couples, families & clubs.  These resorts are the  <I> sine qua non</I>  of Belize snorkeling  &  Belize diving vacations. </P>

Packages at Manta Resort are the same, & all clients must arrive at BZE Airport no later than 2 pm Saturday, preferably before 12:30 pm if you can. The compelling reason for this timeline is that the walk-on ferry from Belize Tourism Village (near the Radisson Ft. George Hotel waterfront) departs that dock at 3 pm sharp, so our clients can always make it safely across the Belize Barrier Reef well before sunset, with time to spare.  Clients MUST be at the ferry dock comfortably BEFORE 3 pm. That means an ideal arrival time at BZE International Airport would be before 1 pm, to be safe & sound.   And please remember, this ferry to Blackbird Caye only sails Wed's & Sat's.</B>

<P>Blackbird Caye never has looked better in the last decade.  And Manta Resort will soon become a full notch even better.  Now, rightfully these two tropical island resorts can be called the class acts in Belize, the best tropical vacation destinations on the Belize Barrier Reef.  Blackbird Caye Resort & Manta Resort passed our  <B>WHITE GLOVE TEST</B> for all key criteria: </P>

<P><B>*  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">QUALITY of MEALS</B></font> -- delicious & filling, plenty of variety daily, fun surprises several times a week, seldom greasy or overly salted, delightful from soups to entrees to desserts;  the servers are prompt & quick responding to special requests.</P>

<P><B>*  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">QUALITY of CABANA AMENITIES</B></font> -- the bathrooms are clean as a whistle;  the beds are firm with spotless linens; the cabanas are dust & bug-free; & Blackbird Caye even installed small high-tech stereos inside your room so you can bring down your own vacation CDs.</P>

<P><B>*  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DIVE BOAT CLEANLINESS & REPAIR</B></font> -- Their boats gleam;  the engines rumble with well-oiled smoothness;  the tanks & weights are safely stowed & always in ready-to-roll order;  & the decks would make even Niles Crane crack a smile. The dive vessel & snorkeling boat crews take genuine pride in their work, & it shows from stem to stern.</P>

<P><B>*  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">STAFF ATTITUDE & SERVICE ACUMEN</B></font> -- impeccably polite, witty & warm, without becoming solicitous;  friendly & laid back with plenty of cool workaday humor.  Staffers are cheerful  in catering even to nuance favors (such as knocking down a few green coconuts & placing them in a fridge for cool evening coco-tails, with a straw punched through one stem-eye...)   </P>

<P><B>*  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DAILY TLC in the GROUNDSKEEPING & BEACH-SWEEPING Dept.</B></font> -- no complaints here;  the staff fogs for bugs daily & cleans the beachfront before you rise, & the lads eliminate all litter close to the cabanas.  Have to concede there's a  little flotsam & jetsam -- from plastic bottles to snack wrappers -- gathering half a mile south down the beach, due to the  <B>*&@#$%</B>   cruise ships, but that's pandemic in the western Caribbean.  The beach boys work their tails off to keep things clean, so give 'em a good word.</P>

<P>You name it, these folks at Blackbird get it right.  And they get it right on time.  One prominent Belize mainland family owns both these properties & they keep their resorts running like fine Swiss watches.  That's a delicate & perfect balance most resorts never reach:  keeping staff discipline without getting stuffy; maintaining good humor without pandering.  Blackbird's got a refreshing feel to it, never rushed.  Plus you will never have to deal with crowds.  Not a chance.  Both resorts typically host from 24 to 34 clients at one time, no more, so the service in dining room, dive boat, dockside or on the beach is never strained.</P>

<P>If something is a bit off in your meal, for example, just huddle with the dining room steward for a moment & immediately your meal is modified next time around -- precisely as you wish -- never an eyebrow raised.   Always with a sincere smile.  The vibe is healthy & relaxed at these Belize island resorts.  Never arms-length or pretentious, despite the parade of powerful & creative people who have blessed us with their patronage over the years.  Here's one cool factoid, to show the  laid-back  <I>ethos</I>  at Blackbird & Manta.  The resort bars & beverage fridges are run on an honor system; so you simply check off a beer or soda next to your name each time you remove an item; then you tally it all up at week's end.  Nobody cheats.  That would feel like ripping off your granny's purse for gas money.</P>

<P>The staff at Blackbird Caye Resort is superbly trained, attentive without being obsequious & just plain fun to hang with on a hot day.  They will play a kick-fanny game of volleyball with you about an hour before sunset when the air temps cool off.  And they can really mash that ball, believe it ! These employees do their jobs with obvious relish.  They offer you a daily can-do attitude, seldom the world-weariness you see in tourist-glutted destinations of the Yucutan, Jamaica, Roatan or the northern Bahamas.  The dive staffs are well trained, efficient & mindful of client safety at every juncture, while never getting in your face with annoying mother-hen fussiness.  If you demonstrate your dive skills are solid the first day, they leave you alone to explore the reefs at your own pace, so you can relish your day in an unfettered way.</P>

<P>Unlike that grating David Spade commercial -- where the phone rep delights in demonic "No! No! No's!" -- one virtually never hears that  discouraging word spoken by a staffer at these Belize dive resorts.  Unless, that is, one were to ask a bonehead question such as "May I please cut a Scythian swath through that fish school with my speargun?"  or "How 'bout we dump these pop cans over the side so we can make more room for our dive gear?"  or  "Whattya say we flush that octopus from his lair with some Chlorox, so I can take him home for my kid's aquarium?"  or  "Would you please nestle six gold-foiled truffles on my scrambled egg plate tomorrow at 5 am?"</P>

<P>OK, lampoons aside, few are the clients who'd ever dream up such Neanderthal demands.  So we wanted to make a point with some Jim Carey hyperbole.  If you  <I>know </I> you're a client who wants to hunt with a speargun,  or trap little fishies for your aquarium,  or corral a dolphin pod with a speedboat & splash over to the juvies while clutching your clunky U/W video housing,  or if you're tempted to litter the waters in any way, or hassle the staff with pointy-headed demands a la Zsa Zsa Gabor on a 3-martini bender, then please do not bother booking with Blackbird Caye.  Please & thank you.  All the rest of you good folks, the other 99% of the world's sunseekers, welcome aboard the "Big Bird" island ferry & we look forward to serving you soon.  We promise to do so with sea soul, plus a bit o' wit & wisdom earned by repping these Belize dive resorts for more than 2 decades now.  We have served many  hundreds of clients who've flown down to Belize & made friends for life.</P>

<B>Another seven factors that make Blackbird Caye Resort & Manta Resort perennial magnets for dedicated divers & snorkelers alike: 
</font>
</B> </P>

<B><LI> &nbsp; (1) &nbsp; </B><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IDEAL for SCUBA DIVING NOVICES</font></B> 
-- Our scuba newbies love these island, pure & simple.  Newly-certified  divers can learn their sport in warm gentle waters, that typically are shallower, with cleaner sandy bottoms & offer higher visibility than many other Caribbean locales.  So our new divers -- & snorkelers too -- feel more embraced by the local seascape & less knocked about by dodgy currents & murky "viz."  On a so-called "so-so day" at Blackbird Caye, you still get wonderful 60 to 70-foot visibility + water temps in the high 70s & air temps well into the 80s F.  But most of the year, week after glorious week, except a few weeks a year, the ocean waters will bathe you in bathtub temps well into the low 80s F., with "viz" up to 80 feet, even as clear as 120 feet on a golden winter or spring day.   What's more, Blackbird Caye seems historically blessed to be in a "foul-weather shadow," well outside classic hurricane pathways.  Been that way for several decades,<P>  

<B><LI> &nbsp;  (2) &nbsp; </B><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">CALM, PATIENT DIVE INSTRUCTORS</font></B> 
-- And the beat goes on, funseekers.  Blackbird instructors are patient, easygoing, gifted with good humor & a friendly touch that puts new divers, or middle-agers away from scuba diving for awhile, immediately at ease.  Therefore our clients report month after month that their learning curve is quick & satisfying, & the diver's confidence grows very soon after their first day in the water. These Belize resorts are a perfect place for new divers to get certified from scratch, or to complete an Open Water referral after finishing their classroom & pool work in mainland North America or Europe.<P>

<B><LI>  &nbsp; (3) &nbsp; </B><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">FUN CHALLENGES for EXPERT DIVERS & SNORKELERS</font></B> 
-- While our new divers feel relaxed & confident scuba diving at Blackbird Caye Resort, there still are plenty of invigorating challenges out there for experienced scuba divers & veteran free divers.  If you need some underwater rock'n'roll, the instructors will prep a separate vessel for you & take you to some major rush-inducing dive sites, whenever logistics allow.  Some of the drift dives & swim-throughs on the outer perimeter reef, & of course the renowned Blue Hole dive discovered by Jacques Cousteau, offer thrilling adventures for folks seeking a little adrenaline to spice up their dive day.  You can get any level of challenge you desire, any day of the week you look for it,  <I>amigos del mar </I>... Just ask for it.<P>

<B><LI> &nbsp; (4) &nbsp; </B><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">FREE SNORKELING BOAT DAILY ! </font></B>
-- If you are an avid snorkeler, & you want to get on a dive boat to visit more remote reefs offshore for the best critter counts & corals, then Caribbean resorts typically charge about USD $65 to $85 per client per half day,  for you to jump onboard with the scuba divers.  Blackbird Caye  Resort & Manta Resort offer a dedicated snorkeling vessel to zip you over to some beautiful offshore snorkeling locales,  <I>tout  de  suite.</I>  And the price per client?  The big old O ring -- ZERO! That's right, sunseekers.  Free snorkeling trips from a clean fast boat, twice a day if you want.   No strings attached.  Well, except your anchor line -- always lowered carefully on sand or rock, never on living corals.<P>

<B><LI> &nbsp; (5) &nbsp; </B><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SINGLES, COUPLES, FAMILIES, all are EQUALLY WELCOME</font></B> 
-- Blackbird & Manta are not yuppie havens, nor 5-diamond wannabes.  They are beautifully appointed, a good yoeman's 4 stars.  Upscale but not upstart.  No favoritism.  There is something here on the Belize atolls for every age group & lifestyle, even families with water-wise children during spring break, for example.  These resorts are NOT only for scuba divers.  In short, no worries all ye avid snorkel munchers.  Scuba divers do not dictate the whole resort vibe, though our divers are treated  with a ton of TLC each day.  Scuba divers have their separate diving vessel.  With that in mind, these resorts appeal to adventuresome families with young children because the waters are safe & the shorelines are kid-friendly, plus you can get a day-nanny quite affordably.   Tropical bugs are seldom a big problem, as long as you bring a little Skin-so-Soft & some low-test DEET.  The constant afternoon & evening breezes not only keep the skeeters at bay, but they foster delightful sleeping weather all year around.  All cabanas have A/C, modern showers, tile floors, ceiling fans & excellent bedding. </P>

<B><LI> &nbsp; (6) &nbsp; </B><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">WORLD-CLASS BONEFISHING & TROPICAL FLY-FISHING</font></B> 
-- If you are keen on tropical fishing, you can get a permit easily here, all punds intended.  The local guides for topwater fly-fishing, or jigging from a skiff for bonefish in the afternoon, are among the most skilled in the western Caribbean.  These Belize dive resorts are meccas for serious bonefish & permit-fishing enthusiasts.  Since the early 1990s we have catered to fishermen & fisherwomen from all across Europe & North America, even  <I>pescadores </I>  from Bolivia, Brazil & Argentina.  Fly fishermen worldwide are pretty passionate about their sport, & Blackbird Caye's guides speak the lingo; they walk the walk with quiet savvy.  Please check the price sheets below for both resorts, with adjusted custom packages for a private fullt-time guide all week.  Fishing packages are a tad spendy, granted, but there's a logical reason why.  Our island associates need to bring expert guides out from the mainland, special-order for each client on a custom basis.  Plus the resort pays for all the guide's transport, housing & meals for an entire week.  Only two fishing clients per week are allowed at each resort, normally, so the fishing skiff is never crowded nor rushed.  Rather it's an exquisite Belizian reef fishing adventure, well worth the extra cost, our clients report.</P>


<B><LI> &nbsp; (7) &nbsp; </B><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">INTERESTING  ARRAY of PROFESSIONAL GUESTS</font> </B>
--  You will <B> always</B>  find a good supper table conversation at Blackbird Caye Resort.  Dullards & the self-infatuated are blessedly rare on these islands.  You might find a Fortune 500 CFO from Silicon Valley seated next to a construction contractor from Colorado; & they hit it off great -- both in flipflops & Grateful Dead T shirts. These Belize dive resorts not only cater to successful professional couples seeking a romantic escape, but to life-positive families on a big tropical reunion.  Also to non-stodgy corporate groups building a new team <I> esprit.</I>   There's plenty of open beach space, palm trees & flowering bushes that separate many of the cabanas.  Therefore these dive resorts offer high privacy & a tranquil ethos that mellows our vacationers, long fed up with noisy meet-market destinations & sardine-blanket beaches like Cancun or Cabo.  Honeymooners  <I>love  </I>Blackbird & Manta.  We have served scores of honeymoon couples & a number of fun family reunions over the years.  Nobody puts on airs at Blackbird Caye Resort.  From the model in Rome, to the peregrine Microsofties from Seattle, to the single woman stockbroker from NYC, to the Pittsburgh millworker's family with young kid in tow who saved 3 years for the trip, to the 20-something newlyweds whose folks treated them to a snorkeling honeymoon...  All seasons, all years, you are all warmly welcomed here at Blackbird Caye Resort & Manta Resort.  That's why folks fly back home & write us the nicest letters or e-mails of thanks, year after year.  We've kept a scrapbook filled with those happy client comments, never to be tossed.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><P><B>IMPORTANT BOOKING RULES for our BELIZE DIVE RESORTS:</B></P>
</font>
<B>
<UL>
</FONT>

<LI>All clients need to ensure their flights arrive at BZE International Airport NEVER later than 2 pm, but preferably before 1 pm to ensure you catch the walk-on passenger ferry at the Belize Tourism Village, next to Radisson Fort George Hotel on the city's waterfront.  That ferry to both Belize resorts leaves the dock at 3 pm sharp.  Further, all clients need to make sure their departure flights on the final day will leave BZE Airport NEVER earlier than noon, to ensure a smooth connection from the ferry, which arrives at the Belize Tourism Village some time between 10:30 am & 11 am.</LI><P>

<LI>The passenger ferry to Blackbird Caye Resort runs only on Wednesdays or Saturdays all year long.</LI><P>

<LI>All Blackbird Caye Resort dive packages or snorkeling packages are calculated for double-occupancy.  When two parents have a child in their double cabana, we offer small discounts for the third person. But we discourage 3 adults in one cabana. </LI><P>

<LI>Single supplement: 30 % extra for a solo person in any cabana, duplex or triplex unit. </LI><P>

<LI>Except for occasional seasonal specials, not in effect at this time, both Belize resorts charge extra for sodas, bottled water, beer, wine & bar drinks.  Furthermore, tips are also extra at both Belize resorts, yet are solely up to the discretion & goodwill of each individual client.</LI><P>

<LI>Please note for <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
"Belize Navidad" – </font>Holiday weeks carry a $100 per client holiday premium for Christmas & New Years weeks at Blackbird Caye Resort.</LI><P>

<LI>The resort owners reserve their right to modify some of these policies, from season to season, to meet unexpected client volume or airline schedule changes.  However in our 23+ years experience of repping a number of Belize resorts, the owners keep their booking policies consistent & user-friendly.</LI><P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<B>GROUP LEADER INCENTIVES !!!  </font>With large groups at both resorts: for every 9 fully paid divers, the 10<SUP>th</SUP> diver gets a free land package.   If groups are a blend of divers & snorkelers, then the free land package is for a snorkeler.  Air tickets are not comped.  This seasonal offer holds until resort owner's further notice.  Blackbird Caye Resort has 12 private oceanside cabanas + 1 duplex + 1 triplex & can accommodate 34 clients max for large family dive vacations or corporate dive vacation groups.  Manta Resort has 11 cabanas + a 2 BR Family House with hide-a-bed included that can sleep a family of 8 persons.  Manta Resort therefore can accommodate 30 clients max for large family dive vacations or corporate dive vacation groups.</LI></UL>

<P>Professional dive guides &amp; photographers agree that the atolls of
the Southern Belize Barrier Reef offer the Caribbean's cleanest waters,
the most colorful corals &amp; the most vivid array of marine life. Manta
Resort &amp; Blackbird Caye Resort have been acknowledged as the finest
of Belize's premier dive resorts, for many years now. These private islands are world-class
getaways, with dazzling dives, truly delicious cuisine &amp; a refreshingly
mellow staff. Belize diving just shines. And Manta Resort &amp; Blackbird Caye
Resort outshine the best of Belize's fine outer atoll vacation retreats.
For many years now, travel writers &amp; professional dive guides have
placed both Manta Resort &amp; Blackbird Caye Resort at the top of the
'A' List for Western Caribbean scuba Meccas. Belize diving is as good as
it gets in the Caribbean.  And we believe the bona fide soul of Belize diving 
is way south of the much-publicized & tourist-trampled Ambergris Caye, at 
Glover's Reef or Turneffe Atoll.  Here are specific details about these nerve centers of serious Belize diving.</P>


<P>Meanwhile, Blackbird Caye Resort is located 32 miles east of Belize
City, on the far eastern side of the Turneffe Atoll. Glover’s Reef &amp;
Turneffe Atoll are two of only three atolls in the entire Caribbean, which
are fully ringed by an eliptical fringing reef. They are just the sort
of exquisite diving islands you would find in the South Pacific or the
Indo-Pacific. There are no other atolls anywhere in the greater Caribbean-Atlantic
region, except those found along the Belize Barrier Reef.  This makes Belize dive vacations a world-class 
adventure, we feel.</P>

<P>About 170 miles long, the Belize Barrier Reef is the second longest
barrier reef on earth, right after Australia's renowned. The most remote
&amp; unspoiled of these three Belize atolls is Glover's Reef at the southern
end of this magnificent coral perimeter. At the far southern end of Glover's
Reef is a beautiful 12-acre isle, Manta Resort, that is the site of Belize's
most exclusive resort for world-class scuba diving &amp; snorkeling. Clients
who prefer a less isolated island, yet still want the electric flavor of
Belize ocean wilderness, like Blackbird Caye Resort a lot, because it is
very close to outstanding reef diving, yet offers scads of good nature
hiking as well. Blackbird Caye is further north &amp; less isolated.</P>

<P>The shallow area near Blackbird Caye covers 210 square miles. Blackbird
is only 18 miles away from Half Moon Caye. From there it's just a quick
8-mile jaunt to the world-famous Blue Hole. The Blue Hole is now the most
world-famous dive site in Belize, &amp; was discovered by Jacques Cousteau
many years back on one of his many exploratory forays into the Caribbean Sea.
The Blue Hole has become a must-see dive for many Caribbean dive travelers
on a mission to see all the most famous sites on the Belize Barrier Reef.  While not the most 
colorful dive site in Belize, the Blue Hole is worth a fun medium-long day trip from Turneffe Atoll.  
Yep, she's not the be-all-and-end-all of Belize dive vacations, but the ol' Blue Hole still packs 'em in.</P>

</P></CENTER>


<P>Manta Resort is located about 57 miles southeast of Belize City, &amp;
about 28 miles east of Dangriga, Belize, right in the heart of the living
Belize Barrier Reef. For additional bearings, Manta Resort is also about
78 miles west of Roatan Island in Honduras.</P>


<P>To get to Blackbird Caye Resort, or to Manta Resort, you board a stable
fast yacht-ferry for a sensational ride (about 57 miles to Manta, &amp; 32 miles
to Blackbird). These speedy ferries depart from the Radisson Hotel or the beautiful new Belize Tourism Village on the waterfront park in Belize City, depending on the season. From the mainland,
these super-fast vessels rocket across the Belize Barrier Reef and into
the sheltered mangrove lagoon of Turneffe Island Atoll, or out to the wonderfully
remote sandy atoll of Glover’s Reef. On the isle of Blackbird Caye Resort
you can find 4,000+ acres of pristine tropical forests, as well as several 
fascinating miles of eco-trails. You can traipse across this enormous Turneffe Island atoll
&amp; explore the many wildlife &amp; plant forms at your leisure. You
see, leisure is all you have time for around here! That’s the law, amigo, on our Belize dive vacations.
</P>

<P>Blackbird Caye Resort's co-owners, who also used to own Manta Resort, say they
are dedicated to the preservation of diverse marine and wildlife in the
Belize Barrier Reef. They call their resort at Blackbird Caye an ecologically-designed
property, &amp; it shows in the care given daily.</P>

<P>At Blackbird Caye Resort &amp; its fringing isles, you can dive vertical
walls just beyond the coral reef in front of your cabana. These lush &amp;
life-engulfed coral sectors extend for miles in both directions. They offer
divers unlimited opportunities to experience large tubular sponges, enormous
basket sponges, vivid purplish Gorgonia (sea fans), perky little reef fish,
big barracuda, schools of permit and jellyfish, sea turtles, lobsters,
snapper &amp; crabs galore. Belize dive vacations = undersea critters 2 D Max.</P>

<P>For deep-sea or reef fishing, Turneffe Island &amp; Glover’s Reef atolls are nirvana
on a pole-tip. There are innumerable creeks, channels &amp; tidal flats
at Blackbird Caye, &amp; the luxurious warm lagoon flats inside the atoll
rim of Glover’s Reef, which offer species that won’t quit: permit, tarpon,
bonefish, groupers, barracuda, snook, snappers. Beyond the outer reef rim
you will find sailfish, huge marlin, kings &amp; wahoo. Both resorts are
equipped to handle all-day deep-sea fishing charters. Their Belizian fishing guides are
skilled &amp; they know the secret spots.</P>

<P>Super die-hard fly fishermen relish Blackbird Caye Resort because it’s
close to excellent feeding grounds for bonefish, a translucent critter
known for its rowdy fighting &amp; wily ways. Blackbird Caye Resort also
offers fly fishermen the rare &amp; elusive golden bonefish. </P><BR>

<BR>



<P>A little further down the barrier reef, from the air, the Manta Resort 
island – named Southwest Caye -- looks like a living gem, with hundreds
of meters of white sand rimming the main island, cabanas nestled under
swaying palms, &amp; a calm shallow greenish-blue lagoon right off the
beaches -- perfect for safe family snorkeling. At the rim of the reef that
girdles this island is a moderately shallow zone that glows with a vivid
emerald-turquoise tint. This zone is loaded with fish-rich coralheads everywhere
-- enough to get even the most jaded scuba diver's heart to quicken. The
corals &amp; sponges of Manta Resort’s waters are nearly South Pacific
intensity. No place else in the Caribbean will you find this degree of
underwater color. The atolls of Central Belize are the <I>sine qua non</I> of
Caribbean scuba, pure &amp; simple. Manta Resort is as good as it gets
underwater in the greater Caribbean region, most of our professional dive
colleagues, photographers &amp; guides would agree.  Belize dive vacations are set apart from the 
humdrum of tourist-infested Caribbean dive tour locales.</P>

<P>Outside that emerald-turquoise zone, the ancient volcano rim (safely
extinct of course!), upon which Manta Resort's island formed eons ago,
drops off steeply to a vast wall that starts first as iridescent royal
blue then turns gradually dark blue then jet black. There is no end to
the visual enchantment of this island, both topside &amp; underwater. 
The true heart of Belize diving is found on these atolls of 
Manta Resort & Blackbird Caye Resort.  And we feel that Belize diving is 
the real nerve center for the best of Caribbean diving.  Photographers
will whiz through film rolls like sugar sand through a sieve.</P>

<P>Manta Resort &amp; Blackbird Caye Resort each have their own water desalination
facility &amp; luxury amenities with a rustic, almost South Pacific, feel
to them. Manta Resort features 11 hand-crafted mahogany cabanas, each with
2 beds, a dresser, night stand &amp; a fan. The bathrooms are very modern
&amp; equipped with hot showers. The cabanas are very rustic &amp; old-fashioned,
like a fishing resort or hunting lodge might be, not fancy, but very clean
&amp; they have a wonderful waterworld wilderness &quot;feel&quot; to them.
Electricity is 110 volts -- just like the U.S. has. Each Manta Resort cabana
offers a front porch hammock, where you can laze away in the cool breeze.
This breeze, incidentally, also helps keep the bugs away many days, another plus about Belize diving.</P>

<P>The transfer speedboat to Manta Resort only picks up clients on Saturdays, so all travelers
must arrive in Belize City no later than 2 p.m. -- better yet before 1 pm to be safe & sound -- on their first day. Kids
are always welcome at Manta Resort; &amp; those under three stay free,
while kids under 12 stay for half price. All kids 12 & older are considered on adult packages. 
Meals are huge, tasty &amp; wonderful
&amp; you'll always have what you need. The Manta Resort menu varies from
seafood to traditional Belizian to Continental style to Mexican style;
&amp; there are generous breakfast &amp; lunch buffets every day. Be sure
to wear a belt to this resort with a couple extra notches. You’ll need
‘em after those brilliant chefs get done with you !  Belize dive vacations also = <I>mucha comida deliciosa.</I></P>

<P>Scuba divers at Manta Resort are pampered to a faretheewell. Nature
does the first part -- with amazing &quot;viz&quot; that often exceeds
100 - 120 feet during dry seasons. The resort features four 25' diving
skiffs, each of which carries only 12 divers -- no cattle boats here! There
are guides on all dives, which vary from 50 - 90 feet on many choice outer
wall sites. You'll never need to slog-swim a long haul back to the vessel,
since your skipper will always bring the boat up to meet you when you surface.<BR>
<BR>
Your Manta Resort divemasters rinse all your gear each evening then set
up your tanks every morning. No sweat, mon! Night dives are usually Tuesdays
&amp; Thursdays. Night dives are always contingent upon weather &amp; currents
being safe. They are not to be missed! At Manta Resort you will see what's
likely the finest array of corals, sponges, large &amp; small fish &amp;
assorted surprise critters from skates &amp; harmless sharks to yes --
manta rays -- anywhere in the Western &amp; Southern Caribbean.  Belize dive vacations deliver.  Always.</P>

<P>Remember, in Belize you'll need to pay several dollars per day per person
for the government's hotel excise tax, nicknamed the "bed tax". You'll pay that either to Manta
Resort or Blackbird Caye Resort, directly on the island, one small nuisance of Belize diving packages.</P>

<P>Another of Manta Resort's charms that draws clients from all over the
world is the sport fishing, which is outstanding even on ordinary days.
You can go fly fishing for bonefish in the flats, or blue-water trolling
for snapper, grouper, barracuda, jacks &amp; mackerel. Rare is the angler
who gets skunked in a week on this fish-engulfed atoll. Bring your own
rod &amp; reel &amp; tackle, of course, Manta Resort requests.</P>

<P>Belize dive vacations are relaxing, pure & simple.  You'll find no phones, TVs, faxes or techno-trappings in your quiet, secluded, ultra-private cabanas at Manta Resort. However, in the unlikely
event of a medical emergency, Manta Resort is linked by powerful radio
to the mainland &amp; urgent air evacuations are easy to do here, but so far never needed on our 
Belize diving tours.</P>

ocean rose abruptly after the last Ice Age, &amp; collapsed the roof of
a huge cave, producing a gaping 400-foot-deep crater. For safety reasons,
your guides will take you no deeper into this mysterious Blue Hole than
130 feet -- to check out some cool underwater stalactites. This Blue Hole is likely
the most sought-after dive site on the Belize Barrier Reef.</LI>

feet)</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"> </FONT>Not only is one of Blackbird
Caye Resort’s owner’s named Al, but this is also the proper name of a very
special fish, kind of a neighborhood mascot for years, who lives on this
steep wall with crags &amp; overhangs. We'll let you discover who he is;
&amp; save the surprise for your first visit to Blackbird Caye Resort.
Expect to bump into big burly barracuda around here. </LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Majestic Alley:</FONT> </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Shallow
Dive (30-50 feet)</FONT> This site is bristling with staghorn &amp; elkhorn
corals &amp; crowds of busy reef fish all trying to make a living (&amp;
avoid getting munched) The teeming undersea life here is a great escape
from the pressures of work, phones, faxes &amp; landlubbing nonsense. This
is the kind of diving that has given the Belize Barrier Reef it's reputation
for excellent scuba diving adventures. Not many dive vacations or custom
dive tours anywhere in the Caribbean can offer Belize diving sites like these classics
at Manta & Blackbird Caye.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Coral Gardens:</FONT> </FONT></B>This
a simple, fun dive to 30 feet max, running along a sandy coral ridge. On
a good day this can be one of the most beautiful shallow reef dives in
the area, punctuated by Caribbean heart corals of every color, nearly all
of them robust &amp; good-sized.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Grouper City:</FONT> </FONT></B>A
way-fun drift dive along a 50-70 foot wall with many of these comical,
bulky fish hulking by the wall day after day, looking for diver handouts.
You can pet these gentle behemoths, just don't place your fingers too closely
to their powerful mouths. Fingers look a lot like edible tidbits when you
have a brain the size of a tangerine. Your Blackbird Caye Resort divemasters
will remind you not to give these Caribbean groupers a reason to munch
digits.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Coco Point: </FONT></FONT></B>Drift
dive along lush &amp; colorful coralheads at about 60-80 feet. There’s
an extremely cool steep dropoff here with a wealth of garden eels lurking
down in patches of sand at 30-50 feet.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Blackbird’s Cut:</FONT></FONT></B>
Medium dive (20-70 feet) which slants across the varied reef zones, from
the lagoon to the drop-off, giving you a nice broad view of underwater
habitats &amp; their residents, a good primer on Belize diving. </LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Soldier’s Caye:</FONT> </FONT></B>Shallow
dive (30 feet.) Good first dive. Large variety of corals and fishes, especially
pillar corals &amp; moray eels. This is a perfect dive for your first day,
to get your sea legs back &amp; get into the mellow groove of Blackbird
Caye Resort &amp; its pristine host island. Scuba diving should always
be this easy &amp; this colorful. That's the case on Belize dive vacations, guys. Almost any day on the Belize Barrier
Reef -- it is !</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Oasis:</FONT></FONT></B> This
can be a somewhat deeper dive (60-120 feet) You'll enjoy large black corals
and sponges growing from a vertical clif, up to sandy stretch with coral
patch communities. Another Caribbean diving gem &amp; a Belize Barrier Reef classic.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Turtle Ridge:</FONT></B> </FONT>Medium-depth
dive (maximum 70 feet) This dive is easily navigated along coral ridges
running from 30 feet to 65 feet. Excellent night, day, or twilight dives
are easily managed here. </LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Coliseum:</FONT> </FONT></B>This
is an intriguing yet relaxing shallow 20-60 foot dive. Tall towers of boulder
corals form protected pathways down to the wall. Lots of little dwellings
for fish everywhere, making this another Belize diving classic. </LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Stingray Motel:</FONT> </FONT></B>Shallow
dive (35-60 feet). Large patch of sand freqented by resting southern stingrays,
eagle rays &amp; some beautiful specimens of Hawksbill turtles. These turtles
are primo. This is one of the more popular Blackbird Caye Resort classics,
&amp; one that Belize divemasters tend to favor as well.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Crabwalk:</FONT> </FONT></B>Deep
dive (maximum 130 feet) Channel-clinging crabs inhabit the many interesting
little holes in this wall, while schools of horse-eyed jacks mill around
this site.  Our Belize dive vacations offer challenges for even the most experienced scuba divers.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Elbow:</FONT> </FONT></B>A
deep or medium dive. Great place to see the big pelagics. Some ardent divers
go to Belize just to relish repeat visits to this classic dive site. The
live-aboards can’t do it; no place to anchor right nearby. The Blue Planet
Divers, dive shop for Blackbird Caye Resort, can operate drift diving here
quite beautifully, &amp; safely. This is one splendid Belize diving adventure!</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Calabash Cut:</FONT> </FONT></B>Medium
dive (40-80 feet). Here you'll be amazed by the spectacular tube &amp;
barrel-type sponges, plus vividly-hued rope corals &amp; healthy hulking
encrusting sponges, of the kind only the Caribbean can dish out.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Little Calabash:</FONT></FONT></B>
Heart-starting wall drop at 60 feet. You’ll be treated to an overhang with
healthy black corals, festooned with tons of tube and barrel sponges. Some
pretty chunky Caribbean loggerhead turtles are regular visitors here &amp;
they have been known to cut a few humorous swimming antics for your viewing
pleasure. </LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Chinaman's Wall:</FONT></FONT></B>
Medium dive (30-100 feet). The rim along the wall is packed with hard and
soft corals. A good dive to spy little shrimp &amp; wrasses operate their
cleaning stations for larger fish. This is an old, established Caribbean
dive site &amp; it was named well before the Age of Political Correctness,
so please forgive the inadvertent clumsiness of the &quot;non-'90s&quot;
name. Blackbird Caye Resort maintains complete respect for all races &amp;
cultures, as do we at U.S. Dive Travel.  This is just an old dive-site name, a Belize diving mainstay, 
not a political treatise, so no worries mates.</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>West Side Story:</FONT></FONT></B>
Medium dive (30-80 feet). Here you’ll find no monster walls, only gently
sloping reef, with plenty of the ever-rugged mangroves sinking their tough
stalks down in the shallows. This dive is super-typical of scores of smaller
caye dives along the Belize Barrier Reef.  So to lift a line from Bernstein, you might find Sharks, but 
never Jets on our Belize dive vacations!</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Long Caye Wall:</FONT>
 </FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">Medium
dive </FONT>20-80 feet.) The wall starts at 25 feet &amp; soon thereafter
treats you to scads of brightly-tinted soft corals &amp; sponges. You will
also find tunicates, an occasional large grouper, plenty of sea slugs &amp;
some days a cloud of hefty jacks will roll on through &amp; get your adrenaline
flowing, as they blot out the sunshine overhead for a few exciting seconds.
The scuba diving action in Belize never seems to quit !</LI>

<P>
</P>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Coral Canyon:</FONT> </FONT></B>Shallow
35-foot dive, which explores the buttresses of the fore-reef. You’ll see
huge coral formations inhabited by fishes, crabs, lobster, and the occasional
school of tarpon. This is another venerable Belize diving classic at Blackbird Caye Resort,
&amp; the Belize Barrier Reef -- not to be missed.</LI>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P><b>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT>

<P>All prices for Belize scuba diving & Belize snorkeling packages listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging & diving prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; & that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our tropical vacation experts normally secure wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals.  WE can hold the line on Belize scuba diving & Belize snorkeling packages, & when you book early enough we secure wholesale air tickets. </P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above Belize scuba diving & Belize snorkeling packages show prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At many Belize dive resorts, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International &amp; commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients on our Belize dive vacations start at $55 per person for the land portion + $35 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients on all our Belize scuba diving & Belize snorkeling packages may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. Solo clients on most of our Belize scuba diving & Belize snorkeling packages will always pay a single supplement to secure a private room -- normally 30% more.</P>

<P>For all our Belize scuba diving & Belize snorkeling packages the preferred payment mode for dive resorts & side tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any Belize diving vacation reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest & our prices the lowest in this industry, & thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa & Mastercard for all our Belize dive vacations.</P>

<P>Remember, all tropical vacation clients on these Belize diving vacations will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $40 - $50 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; & away you go. Best of luck with your Belize diving plans. We hope your Belize scuba diving vacation is a safe & satisfying adventure. Blessings & best wishes with ALL your Belize scuba vacations.</P>

<P>Best fishes too!</P>
