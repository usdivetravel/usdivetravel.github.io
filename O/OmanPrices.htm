</FONT><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000">BEST-VALUE HOTEL in the MUSCAT AREA, RADISSON SAS:<BR></b>
</FONT><P>After spending several weeks inspecting most major hotels &amp; resorts in northern Oman, with in-depth onsite tours plus interviews of management teams, we can make all these following recommendations in good faith. It is our opinion that the single best-value hotel in Oman, for most visiting dive vacation clients is the Radisson SAS Hotel right in downtown Muscat. </P>
<P>This well-managed hotel is centrally located &amp; therefore easy to grab a cab anywhere you want. Prices are economical in a city where some hotels overcharge for rooms of modest quality. The Radisson has a spirit of service &amp; congenial attention to details that is delightful. Their management is friendly &amp; unpretentious; the staff is johnny-on-the-spot efficient, &amp; most workers are good-humored. There is a sunny, life-positive attitude at this hotel that comes from the top management &amp; filters down.</P>
<P>The Radisson's breakfast &amp; lunch buffets are by far the tastiest meals in the city -- almost extravagant in color, variety &amp; freshness. The in-house grill is superb, &amp; comparable to some of the best 4-star restaurants we have dined at anywhere in the world. </P>
<P>In Muscat, the Radisson SAS standard rooms are not large, nor super luxurious; but they are very clean, quiet &amp; more than comfy, with city views + cable TV + ultra-modern bathrooms + all conventional client services available from the front desk. Most staffers speak excellent English, so there will be no language barriers. Translators for French, German, Spanish &amp; Dutch clients are normally available.</P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>HOTEL INTER-CONTINENTAL, MUSCAT:</P>
</FONT><P></b></b>This is the best 4-star luxury hotel in Muscat, our site inspections showed. Prices are not in the bargain range at all, but for clients seeking higher-than-moderate luxury, at reasonable prices, this hotel beats the Sheraton &amp; Grand Hyatt hands down, in terms of quality-to-price ratio. The rooms here are spacious &amp; ultra-modern, with cable TV &amp; nice garden views, mountain views or ocean views. The restaurant is adequate but not remarkable &amp; the buffets could use a little tender loving care, with less oil &amp; fresher provisions. Front desk workers are courteous &amp; attentive &amp; the staff seems very well-trained. Most staffers speak decent English, so there will be no language barriers. Translators for French, German &amp; Spanish clients are normally available.</P>
<P>Several benefits to staying at the Hotel Inter-Continental are these:</P>
<P>*  Clean grassy campus &amp; one of the best beachside locations in Muscat. The grass needs some spiffing up, but the tennis courts &amp; beach access are nice touches. Beaches in Muscat are not like the sands of Hawaii, or the South Pacific. There are grayish tidal skirts &amp; patches of rougher sand. But the air is fresh &amp; salt-scented, the sands are clean &amp; the views are beautiful. Walks or training runs along the public beaches are good fun.</P>
<P>*  Two excellent swimming pools -- one is for serious workouts, with a nice sun canopy; &amp; the second is a huge garden-like creation that runs like a river under foot bridges &amp; around patios. This is the fanciest swimming pool in the city of Muscat. The pool tenders keep these bodies of fresh water clean &amp; in impeccable condition.</P>
<P>*  The lobby &amp; great room are beautiful, with lean post-modern architecture that creates a pleasing environment for casual meetings, for sitting to read, or just sipping a soda.</P>
<P>*  There is a well-appointed health club, with steam rooms &amp; spa -- very popular.</P>
<P>*  Package includes round-trip airport transfers + all hotel taxes &amp; tariffs.</P>
<P>*  Prices good through Sept. May be subject to nominal changes.</P>
<P>*  Ask about special low season rates available from May through September.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>The WORLD-RENOWNED AL BUSTAN PALACE HOTEL:</P>
</FONT><P></b></b>This 5-star luxury resort is more a work of art than a place to hang your hat. The Al Bustan is one of the most famous hotels in the Arab world &amp; by far the piece de resistance of Omani lodging options. This place needs to be experienced to be believed. Towering more than 70 feet above the grounds, this vast building sits regally on acres of coifed lush grass, with the nicest private beach in all of Oman (more than a kilometer long). </P>
<P>The hotel was built back in the 1980s to house Arab oil ministers for a major summit meeting hosted by the Sultan of Oman. Since then it has drawn hundreds of the best &amp; brightest European &amp; Arabian travelers to its sunny splendor. The lobby alone is worth more than many American hotels, because of the extravagant &amp; acutely detailed tile work, the lush colors &amp; artistry of the walls &amp; colonnades, the 80-foot domed ceiling &amp; the impeccably appointed furnishings. This hotel regularly is visited by European royalty, world statesmen such as Nelson Mandela, &amp; heavy hitters of industry from several continents. </P>
<P>I have examined the grounds of many fine 5-star hotels in my career, &amp; the Al Bustan Palace Hotel ranks among the most breath-taking displays of sheer opulence I have ever seen. Far more elegant &amp; less self-absorbed than anything on Lanai island in Hawaii, for example -- where Bill Gates got married. Bill, you &amp; Melinda should have come here.</P>
<P>The restaurants at Al Bustan Palace Hotel are all top-caliber, &amp; we enjoyed a luncheon buffet here to rival the top restaurants in Manhattan, Chicago or Seattle. The salads were astonishing in their complexity &amp; subtly textured flavors, &amp; there were exotic entrees one normally glimpses only in gourmet magazines. The deserts were enough to launch your palate into lunar orbit. Ah the chocolate mousse, the chocolate....</P>
<P>To be fair to this wonderful hotel (which charges SERIOUS sums for its better rooms), the Al Bustan needs some renovation in the standard rooms, but the managers were very forthright about it. They have indicated that extensive remodeling, to the tune of millions, will be completed before spring 2004. And these guys have the budget &amp; the authority of the Sultan to get the job done right. This hotel is the Sultan's showpiece, &amp; he is a stickler for perfection. Right now, the better suites &amp; ocean-view penthouse units can fetch several thousand U.S. dollars per night, &amp; they are in delightful shape, ready to create any Arabian Nights fantasy you &amp; your spouse might imagine. Call us for price &amp; lodging details. Ocean-view rooms, double-occupancy including gourmet buffet breakfast each day, will start at about OR 155, or about USD $419 per night. Some of the finest panorama penthouse suites will command up to ten times that price per night.</P>

ADVENTURE TRAVEL INSURANCE &amp; PADI<BR>
EMERGENCY EVACUATION INSURANCE -- IMPORTANT !</B><BR>
</FONT><P></b></b>For all Oman diving clients, &amp; all Oman trekking clients too, we ask that you secure your own travel cancellation insurance before vouchers will be issued. All divers should secure PADI Diver Accident Insurance, or D.A.N. worldwide evacuation insurance, in addition to travel insurance. USDT Network does not sell these insurance packages for ethical reasons. But you can research travel insurance on the Internet, easily. We do not accept any commissions from travel insurance firms, as we only want your trip to be better protected -- in the unlikely event of airline cancellations, storms or overseas defaults.</P>
<P>BTW: U.S. Dive Travel is proud to report that we have never had one scuba diving client, nor one wilderness trekker killed or injured in our many years of service. However, we intend to remain humbly thankful for this safety record. The Good Lord has been more than helpful to USDT's many loyal clients. So the credit for this perfect safety record goes to Him &amp; to prudent planning. Help us keep the streak intact, amigos.</P>
<P>Therefore, we insist on safety first for all our clients, no matter what your level of scuba diving, trekking or climbing expertise. Thanks for your cooperation, amigos, as we all try to keep these Oman adventure vacations exciting, sensible &amp; enjoyable for every client.</P>

The deals you can strike with Omani merchants for gold &amp; silver creations, prime frankincense &amp; colorful Asian rugs are really something. With a few shrugs &amp; a smile, these gracious people will give you up to 35% off just about anything, if you ask politely. Local laws &amp; traditions forbid Souq merchants from hoodwinking the tourists. Now isn't that something? How many Asian countries have you visited with this sort of impeccable consumer protection built right into everyday commerce? The Muscat Souq is a must-see. After the Souq, you will visit the <B>Sultan's Palace in Old Muscat</B> near the harbor.

Al Fallah Cave is safe &amp; do-able for most persons who are in good health. The sights are spectacular in this Hoti Cave, especially the underground lake (with its tiny pink fish) &amp; an awe-inspiring main chamber with some massive stalagmites. Photo opportunities abound if you bring a bright strobe &amp; some backup lights. Make sure you have good block-toed hiking shoes (light-weight & breathable), extra flashlight &amp; batteries &amp; some fresh water. If time permits &amp; for extra cost, we can add on another night of camping under the stars at the summit of <B>Jebel Shams</B>, the tallest peak in Oman (9,870 feet, or 3,009 meters).

What makes this wreck a cool site is the profusion of rare cuttlefish, who mate &amp; flutter around in beautifully complex patterns. Good idea to be careful around the Quriat Wreck. If you are an experienced diver, this will be duck soup. If you are a beginner, then tell us &amp; we will substitute a day at <B>Mermaid's Cove</B> or another mellower coastal dive site. Your scuba diving guide will decide on the exact dive site today, based on weather conditions & fitness of the team -- for your maximum safety. There are dozens of fun scuba diving options for you, or challenging options too -- if you have a taste for underwater adventure of the keener sort.

This is a mellow &amp; photogenic day tour for any hikers of modest cardiovascular ability, &amp; you will love it. For those who really want to kick up their heels with some adrenal action, another more advanced <B>swekking</B> canyon further back in the high country may be chosen instead. Serious canyoning enthusiasts, who are up for the more advanced back-country swekking ("swim-trekking" the canyons), must bring all appropriate safety gear from home, including waterproof pack &amp; camera bag, light rock gear, good block-toed hiking boots or approach tennies (light-weight & breathable for the desert heat) &amp; a sunhat, plus long-sleeved nylon or cotton shirt. Do not forget the Ten Essentials from "Freedom of the Hills."

<LI>Round-trip air ticket prices from major North American cities to Muscat, Oman will vary from about <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">USD</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">$1,150 - USD $1,350 per person + tax.</FONT> By way of comparison, these are moderate fares, &amp; are equivalent to air prices from Los Angeles to Australia, or to Fiji, or to many other islands in the South Pacific. These airfares are more economical than flying to Palau, Truk, Yap, Papua New Guinea or Indonesia for most North Americans. Per FAA rules, prices are subject to changes set only by the airlines themselves. U.S. Dive Travel will never mark up your air tickets, &amp; we pledge to do everything possible to secure the lowest fares. </LI>

<P>IMPORTANT NOTE about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B>
</font></font>


<P>First things first for your Oman scuba diving holiday.  Please remember that you will need to secure a formal visa from the Omani Consulate closest to your hometown, before you will be allowed entry into Oman.  Visas for most U.S., Canadian & European citizens are very easy to secure, & take only a couple weeks.  In many cases, you can  get your visa right after your plane lands in Muscat.  The Oman Embassy staffers in Washington, DC are exceptionally gracious & helpful.  They are geared up to encourage eco-responsible tourism; this is quite evident.  Visa fees are nominal & paid via cashier's check to the Omani Embassy or Consul General nearest to you.  Make sure you prepare well for your Oman scuba diving trip.</P> 

<P><B>OMAN VISA PROCESS --  </B>Passport & visa required for all tourists, & for all Oman vacations. Tourist/business visas for multiple-entry issued for stays up to 6 months & valid for 2 years.  Both business or tourist visas require a special official application form & cholera immunization if arriving from infected area & a self-addressed stamped envelope for return of passport by mail. For transit & road travel, please check with the Embassy of the Sultanate of Oman, 2535 Belmont Rd., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008 (202/387-1980, -1981 or -1982).</P>

<P>All package prices listed here for Oman diving holidays are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market.  Land prices are traditionally stable, while air prices may fluctuate for Oman vacations.  Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- a longtime industry standard, per FAA rules.  We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge for one decade now.  We normally secure excellent discount air tickets.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals. But our lodging & Oman diving contracts are set for one year at a time, &amp; therefore are rock solid nearly all seasons.</P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above packages are prices for only the land-based or vessel-based portion of your Oman scuba diving vacation, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms.  At most vacation resorts there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered.  Some exceptions may be noted.  International air tickets & commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs.  Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the lodging + diving components of all Oman vacations.  The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $35 per person for the land portion + $20 pp for published-fare air tickets.  Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving.  Solo clients will always pay a single supplement to secure a private room on their Oman diving holidays -- normally 35% to 50% more -- &amp; possibly a doubling of the standard double-occupancy rate at some resorts.</P>

<P>For our U.S. or Canadian clients, the preferred payment mode for all lodging, diving &amp; side tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars.  All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay only via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars -- no exceptions please.  No personal checks or credit cards will be accepted for the lodging or land-tour portions of any Oman dive vacations, please.  Thank you for your gracious understanding.  Our service level is the highest &amp; our prices the lowest in this industry, &amp; thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin to keep the Ship of State afloat, thereby ensuring that your Oman diving holidays will be brilliant &amp; affordable.  </P>

<P>For published-fare air ticket bookings on your Oman dive vacations, USDT always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard, even from non-U.S. clients.  For discount wholesale air tickets, however, USDT accepts only cashier's checks or wire transfers, please, since we are giving you exceptionally low net rates, below the lowest published discount fares available.  </P>

<P>Remember, all clients to all foreign destinations will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $25 - $45 per client.  USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country.  Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; &amp; away you go.  Best of luck with your travel plans.  We hope your Oman dive vacation is a safe &amp; satisfying adventure.  Blessings &amp; best wishes.</P>

<P>Best fishes too!</P>
