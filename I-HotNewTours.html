<p>Also, every now & then 2 or 3 berths may open up for lucky snorkelers, certain weeks from January through March 2017 -- & also in 2018 -- as random cancellations occur.  Because of the high demand worldwide for these limited whale-watching berths -- if you snooze, you lose, mates.  Therefore, if you feel the Spirit move, you'd  best not tarry.  The phone rings daily for these prized whale-watching live-aboard packages, so stay on your toes, friends :)</p>

<p>Please feel free to phone our live-aboard vacation experts at 952-953-4124 for more details.</p>

</font></font></font></font>

<font color="#000000">

<p>Whale-cruise skipper Capt. Gene Flipse, who is one of the most authentic & life-positive gents we've had the pleasure of collaborating with in decades, is an expert on these whales' behaviors, their delightful quirks & soulful natures.  Here's what Cap'n Gene tells us to expect each heart-starting season...</p>

<p>Every year, from 3,000 to 5,000 humpback whales migrate from their summer feeding grounds in the North Atlantic Ocean to their winter breeding grounds in the Sanctuary for the Marine Mammals of the Dominican Republic, located on the Silver Bank. Under special permit issued by the government of the Dominican Republic, Conscious Breath Adventures leads groups of 18 lucky guests on a stellar bucket-list journey into the Sanctuary to see, swim and interact with these amazingly intelligent, wonderful animals.</p>

<p>The whales gather along the Silver Banks in great numbers to court, mate and give birth and, while floating serenely  on the Silver Bank with the whales, guests will witness the full repertoire of spectacular surface social behaviors including pectoral fin slapping, tail slapping, spyhopping and breaching. It is not unusual to see "rowdy" groups of more than a dozen adult male whales vigorously competing for the attention of an available female. Being among the rowdies will re-format your definition of running with the bulls -- big time!</p>

<p>While the surface show is a fantastic heart-thumper, what brings most adventurers to the Silver Bank is the opportunity to actually jump in the water and swim near these whales in their natural environment, eye-to-eye. During these encounters guests will have the chance to see resting mothers with their playful young calves, with the curious calf frolicking at the surface and interacting with its new friends.</p> 

<p>Another type of soul-stirring encounter is with a singing humpback whale. Humpback whales sing the most sophisticated song in the animal kingdom, and man alive folks -- they are singing their hearts out on the Silver Bank. Conscious Breath Adventures uses hydrophones to listen to the performance, and when conditions are right guests enter the water to literally immerse themselves in the song, with the music shaking them to the bone!</p>

<p>Guests may also be treated to a front row seat to the peak performance of two dancing humpback whales. Dancers are two adult whales in the final throes of their courtship, using their long pectoral fins to spin and whirl and swoop around and below the swimmers, inviting them to be part of the dance, before they depart to mate.</p>

<P>MATAVA RESORT on Kadavu Island is one of the most exciting new destinations we have discovered in the South Pacific in 3 decades.  MATAVA RESORT is such a uniquely gifted green retreat, that it now ranks among our top seven small resorts anywhere in the Pacific. That’s among a couple hundred tropical island locales we've been blessed to visit & review. MATAVA is run by purpose-driven men who refuse to fudge even a smidge on what they know to be true: this beautiful but weary planet is in trouble from careless developers & wanton resource sponges. Thus it needs constant daily TLC, from every caring person, in even the little things to restore a healthy balance to Good Ol’ Mama Earth. These guys at MATAVA have green ethics down to a system, & we will show you how refined & intelligent that system is.  Yet the inspired team at MATAVA RESORT – led by expat Brits Richard Akhtar & Adrian Watt -- keeps the preservationist faith in a humble manner, never tooting horns nor swaggering, never fashioning an idol out of their eco-mission. They go for the green, not the long green, never resorting to self-righteous zeal or stuffy PC (politically correct) politics.  This place is about fun in the sun, with an earth-friendly tilt. MATAVA RESORT (MAH’-tah-vah) is just plain exciting to visit, amigos del mar.  Here is one reason, a major geographic blessing -- MATAVA RESORT is the only vacation destination of note on the entire 65 km of nearly wilderness south Kadavu shoreline. As the only game in town, they enjoy one enormous advantage. While MATAVA RESORT is a comfy 3½ star retreat, fully civilized & offering lush gardens, well-manicured lawns, delightfully rustic cabins (called “bures”) & meals to-die-for delicious, it is also the only significant resort close enough to the famed Astrolabe Reef to reach most dives in a wink. You’ll recall, the Astrolabe is one the world’s greatest living coral expanses. What’s neat is that from MATAVA you can reach most of the isle’s best diving & snorkeling sites in less than 20-30 minutes.  The stunning corals of Astrolabe Reef, which wrap the southern shores on up to the NE wasp’s head in an upside-down fishhook shape, offer more than 80 miles of prime fish habitat & may be the prime polyp-spawning center that seeds much of the entire Fijian archipelago with new coral life each year.  However, mind you, there is always a catch in Paradise. Sorry to be blunt, but MATAVA is not for sissies.  MATAVA RESORT is not the spot for mincing tenderfoot tea sippers with pinky finger extended a la matrons on the Titanic, nor for obsessive-compulsive white glovers & delicate buttoned-down types who, like Niles Crane, seek chrome ‘n’ whitewashed spas. MATAVA RESORT is not for fussy folks who send their steaks back to the chef because they’re not “medium rare with a pale blush.” This place is for adventure-minded folks seeking some of the best reefs & deep sea fishing in the world. MATAVA is for down-to-earth people who don’t mind roughing it a little, who don’t mind 7-10 nights where cell-phones won’t hound you & TVs won’t blare. MATAVA RESORT is not for cream puffs, nor perfectionists, just straight-ahead folks seeking old-fashioned simple pleasures. I mean TLC service with a smile, perfectly fresh breezes with zero pollution, ocean waters so clean they defy the norm Pacific-wide, & the best Fiji diving or Fiji snorkeling you ever could wish for.  MATAVA RESORT offers a square deal for a modest price: great reef diving + world-class deep-sea fishing + easy breezy kayaking & village visits + warmly hospitable service + scintillating supper-table conversations with like-minded eco-travelers.

<BR>
</A></FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000">
<font size=3>
<P>Wait until you see these inside photos of the Maui Guest House.  The value factor here is incredible on one of the priciest isles of the Pacific -- good ol' Maui.  These superbly low rates come in at least USD $200 per room night below the average lodging cost on Maui's famous Ka'anapali Coast, or in the Wailea area, where the mainland glitterati pay WAY too much to play, wine & dine. Meals in Lahaina will run at least 25% - 30% more economical than in Wailea or the Ka'anapali Coast area. Your savings + the less frantic atmosphere are evident immediately, the first day on West Maui. Plus these two beautiful guest homes are within easy driving distance from an excellent dive tour operator -- Extended Horizons -- whose specialty is the pristine & uncrowded diving off Lanai island, right across the channel.  Founded by Erik Stein & Chris Millen, Extended Horizons offers a spacious custom-built aluminum dive vessel -- a 36-footer that caters to only 12 divers at a time -- ideal for clients who prefer a less-crowded scuba experience. Extended Horizons will depart for beautiful Lanai island most days at 6:45 am from Mala Wharf in Lahaina, near the old Cannery at the northern end of Old Lahaina Village. The dive guiding team run by Erik & Chris is one of the most amiable & professionally solid we have worked with in the Hawaiian Islands since the early 1990s. These guys will be big fun to dive with. Plus their divemaster team knows more than 60 classic Lanai dive sites, thoroughly. One neat fact here, the Mala Wharf is only a couple minutes easy drive downhill from Tanna's Maui Guest House. Super convenient location + you avoid all the Lahaina Village traffic. Like we always say -- "Here today, gone t' Maui !"

<font size=3>
<P>
Like some delightful reminder of Aspen or Vail in the 1970s, before commercialism ran rampant, this classic country-style guest inn is perfectly located -- within quick strolling distance from the best scuba center in the village -- LAHAINA DIVERS. We have worked with LAHAINA DIVERS for more than 14 years now, & since day one they have had the top-rated diving yachts on Maui -- big powerful Newton 46s -- the "Dauntless & the Dominion." These boats pack two Cummins turbo-Diesel 430s at the stern, & they really haul when the skip needs to. These boats are roomy enough to accommodate 49 passengers, but they typically carry no more than 20-24 pax at a time. LAHAINA DIVERS offers Nitrox, even custom blends, as well as 56 cf & 100 cf tanks for extra petite gals & extra-large guys.  Clean, quiet, managed by pleasant folks who bend over backwards to accommodate you, LAHAINA INN is nestled smack dab in the heart of this vibrant, colorful village. LAHAINA INN is only walkin' minutes from all the nighttime action, the best restaurants, art galleries, shops & dessert locales; & it's less than 3 blocks easy jaunt from the Lahaina Boat Harbor, where LAHAINA DIVERS two beautiful vessels are moored. LAHAINA INN + LAHAINA DIVERS = a thrifty, convenient, comfortable alternative to the big-buck high-rises on the Ka'anapali Coast, or the prefab crowded hotels in the Kihei area, or the tourist-inundated condo villages of NW Maui. We love Lahaina village, folks; it's a li'l bit country & a l'il bit rock 'n' roll. Ideal for a relaxing, refreshing Maui snorkeling vacation package, or Maui diving vacation, or Maui honeymoon escape.  Once you experience LAHAINA INN, we feel confident you will likely never wrestle with the $350-$450 / night median price at so many coastal hotels on West Maui. This place has our attention, & it deserves yours.

U.S. Dive Travel now is offering carefully planned, customized honeymoon packages for young or middle-aged couples who are fit & fun-loving, & who are seeking to flee the hum-drum-beat of touristy islands like Jamaica, Roatan or Grand Bahama.  Read on, if you're in search of eco-adventures with a backdrop of serious creature comfort + expert guides who know their flora, fauna & archeology to a 'T'.  We've got the ticket for you, honeymooners -- major eco-fun melded with romance to the Nth Degree.  Here's the gist....We just returned from helping several couples organize (in part) the trip of their lifetimes to Windy Hill Resort in the highlands of Belize, San Ignacio Village in the famous Cayo District of Belize.  Our cameras were clicking non-stop for almost 10 days.  Sneak a peek at these brand-new photos of the Belize Barrier Reef islands, the ancient Mayan Ruins of Tikal & Caracol, the sultry little getaways in back-country Belize, where most tourist handbooks -- thank God! -- do not ever venture.  We had the time of our lives, everyone.  We recommend the Belize Highlands & the Tikail Ruins national park in Guatemala as one of coolest, most emotionally inspiring locales we have ever been blessed to visit in Central America.  Reasonably easy to get there, fully safe, affordable yet exotic as the day is golden, dawn to dusk !  Tikal Ruins, the largest pyramids ever built by human hands before the Modern Era in this entire hemisphere, are enough to take your breath away, amigos.  It is tough to understate your emotional & spiritual reaction to the Tikal Ruins.  So check out these new pix & see what you think !!  Hope you go down there & feel blown away by the majesty & sheer visual power of this magical destination, just the way our recent honeymoon couples have been experiencing the tours.  The <B>U.S. DIVE TRAVEL TROPICAL HONEYMOON MANIFESTO</B>, born soon after our own monthlong South Pacific honeymoon in 1990 inspired the very formation of this company -- "Honeymoons were   <I>never   </I>meant to be so-so.  We believe honeymoons are meant to be life-changing, soul-stirring, heart-stoking, eye candy adventures --  <I>nothing</I>   less  --  that a honeymoon couple  will remember for a lifetime."  That's that.    & our experienced honeymoon vacation planners know how to make it happen for you,   <I>tout de suite. </I>   So, when you get a sec', take a look at these glorious, affordable Central American honeymoon packages.  They may rock your worldview for keeps ....</P>

<I>VILLA at DUNBAR ROCK -- there's nothing like this private isle anywhere in the Caribbean !</I></A> </FONT></B>&nbsp; <BR>
Guanaja really is the last best locale for pristine reef diving + snorkeling in the Honduras Bay Islands, since Roatan &amp Utila islands were glutted with tourists &amp; over-development back in the 1990s.  Good buzz abounds in the scuba diving &amp; snorkeling communities of North America &amp; Europe for Guanaja island in Honduras.  Guanaja offers all the dazzling reefs &amp; crystal "viz" that reminds one of Caribbean corals way back in the 1970s -- before tropical tourism billowed  into exploitation.  No worries about that same ol' cycle grinding down Guanaja's virgin ecosystem, because this isle's tiny airstrip only allows a couple 18-seaters a day to arrive &amp depart, ensuring Guanaja will remain pristine for decades to come.  We  <I> live </I>  for islands like Guanaja.  Since 1991 it has been one of our core missions at U.S. Dive Travel to find these gems worldwide, reveal them carefully, then promote them with TLC + respect for delicate social &amp; reef systems.  Never massive gaudy ad campaigns.  Only a privileged few hundred sunseekers visit Guanaja each year.  & nearly everyone we have sent returns home to write us a love letter about their delightful tropical adventure.  That's the operational word here -- "Delight."  Now let's focus on Dunbar Villa itself.  This cool little Mediterranean-style mansion is incredibly affordable, clean, friendly &amp; brimming with tropical adventure options from the best topwater fishing in the Caribbean to scuba diving, snorkeling, mountain hiking, horseback riding &amp; photo jaunts to two quaint Norman Rockwellian villages.  Now here's the prime location magic -- Dunbar Villa sits 300 meters from Guanaja's protected south shore, serenely in the middle of a calm shallow ocean bay, perched regally atop a huge granite dome.  It has to be seen to be believed !  Check our website photos &amp; you may find your heartrate accelarating within a few sec's of opening the page.  Dunbar Villa is something else.  Owned by a successful Texas real estate wizard, who has gives U.S. Dive Travel exclusive access to his private family getaway for 10 of 12 months each year, this Guanaja vacation getaway offers your own staff of personal servants for the week -- maids, cooks &amp; the best scuba diving guide in the Honduras Bay Islands -- at prices on average about USD $450 per client below the Caribbean median.  Dunbar Villa is a favorite of celebrities or corporate exec's on retreat from their jobworld stress.  Professional couples, family reunions, private schools, even gypsy solo travelers are discovering Dunbar Villa too.  This mini-mansion is remote without being isolated -- there's still good telecomm, + a couple nearby villages for desserts &amp; drinks. No roads on Guanaja, funseekers, &amp; that makes the island evern more like a National Geographic dreamscape. Everybody gets around by water taxi &amp; the village is like a miniature Venice, with seawater streets.   Dunbar Villa has delighted hundreds of our preferred clients, from honeymoon couples to families with teens to corporate teams to celebrities fleeing the paparazzi for some Caribbean sun &amp; serenity.  Check the photos, mates, they might just astonish you as you dream of the possibilities !! </P><BR>

<I>MOLOKAI LODGE / KAUPOA BEACH CAMP &amp;<BR>
Eco-adventures with Tim Forsberg's dive & fishing shop.</I></A> </FONT></B>&nbsp; <BR>
At long last, the shy little isle of Molokai is opening up soon for scuba diving vacations. & we are feeling psyched, funseekers, after waiting more than 10 years for this moment!  Molokai is so rarely visited by North American tourists, we sense a watershed moment here for serious snorkelers &amp; scuba divers, who like us are searching for something fresh, sweet-spirited &amp; untrampled, a little wild &amp; yet still comfy.  Visually compelling, spiritually invigorating, emotionally healing.  We call that a <I>"Tropidelic" </I>Hawaii vacation!  But there's more to Molokai dive trips than just the scuba.  You can find something for everybody on Molokai -- scuba diving, snorkeling, mountain biking along 3,900-ft sea cliffs, archery, horseback riding, skeet shooting, serious hiking & mountain trekking, sea kayaking & cultural tours.  The original <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">MOLOKAI RANCH LODGE</B></FONT>, is a classic hunting lodgy 4-star luxury getaway, with a huge Great Room &amp; massive log beams & buttresses, a chandelier &amp; wood paneling Robert Redford might envy in his mountain retreat. The crystal-clear pool, glowing green lawns &amp; indigenous-flora garden are something to behold, &amp; the meals are more art than cuisine. We were treated like <I>ohana</I> (family) by all the staff &amp; it felt so much like home after a few hours, we had to pry ourselves away to take the tours. There's also the new <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">KAUPOA BEACH CAMP</B></FONT>, is an astonishing place, unique in the Pacific -- a cushy tent-bungalow village on the wild west end of the island. There are 40 neatly built "tentalows" &amp; they are 100% comfortable, clean, right near the two pocket cove beaches. These sturdy high-walled canvas bungalows, stretched over aluminum frames, are built atop spacious wooden platforms with a bathroom, huge hotwater shower &amp; a private deck. The showers &amp; toilets are super-clean &amp; solar powered, designed impeccably for minimal impact on the earth. Big healthy wild turkeys strut the grounds like they own the place, &amp; rare Hawaiian monk seals flop around happily all over the beaches, wherever they feel like planting their blubber. This is stylish tropical camping, amigos, &amp; perfect for families with kids, big church groups, or a passel of dive shop buddies from Michigan. It's a cool new take on 21st century camping.  Try the Molokai dive trip !</P>

This is a beautiful 4-star motor-sailer, built to cruise swiftly under sail or when needed, at a healthy 10-12 knots under engine. This dual-power combo is ideal for the often peaceful, sometimes challenging waters of the central Indonesian Archipelago. Komodo Dancer offers 8 luxury cabins (16 passengers) &amp; ample deck space.  This yacht was built &amp; now is managed in Indonesia through PHD's partners, Meridian Worldwide Ltd. &amp; P.T. Ombak Putih.  Komodo Dancer will be based in Bali &amp; will cruise the passages surrounding Bali, Komodo ( a national park), &amp; Flores islands. Air links are easy via Denpassar in Bali. Scuba divers on all cruises also have opportunities for several colorful land excursions.  Here's what Peter Hughes once said of Komodo Dancer, a dive trip project he was excited to create: "The lure of the unexplored is irresistible, &amp;  welcome to a brand new journey to the land of Dragons & Volcanoes, a real life 'Jurassic Park'  above &amp; below the surface of the seas. This is Komodo, Indonesia, one of the last true frontiers of the U/W world. This 'Land That Time Forgot' is located some 200 nautical miles east of Bali, deep in the Indonesian archipelago between the islands of Sumbawa &amp;  Flores.  Most world-class diving sites are usually formed by either unusual volcanic formations of undersea rock <I>or </I>by massive amounts of unusual limestone (coral) deposits. This portion of Indonesia is blessed by<I> both</I> ! You will see plenty of volcanic action as you explore the numerous sea mounts in the area, with vast schools of jacks, pelagics, mantas, the occasional whale shark, &amp; other stunning members of the blue water community. The gusting currents that surge &amp; swirl through the deep channels between Komodo &amp; Rinca islands produce such a wild variety of conditions that there is something here for everybody. Great visibility, drift dives, massive cliffs of black basalt, endless sheer walls &amp; dazzling coral gardens combine to house one of the most prolific &amp; diverse marine ecosystems on earth."  Amen to all of this Peter, &amp; as soon as the time's right, we're psyched about heading back here for some splendid dive trips.</B>

You've gotta love a country where the cops write you a tougher ticket for driving a dusty car than for speeding happily down the highway.  &nbsp;That's Oman. &nbsp;You've gotta love a country where the national cuisine is a palate-perking meld of Lebanese, Greek, Indian, Pakistani &amp; Arabian dishes.  &nbsp;Yep, that's Oman again. &nbsp;Where kids &amp; old folks are revered, &amp; people <I>really</I> do rest on their day of rest.  &nbsp;Where education &amp; medical care are free for most citizens. &nbsp; Where robberies, rapes, assaults &amp; chemical abuse are virtually nonexistent.  Where the weather is sunny &amp; only partly-humid about 9 months a year.  Oman diving isles offer bustling fish schools &amp; big critter encounters that invoke the underwater zest of Costa Rica's Pacific coast or Mexico's Sea of Cortez. &nbsp; (Here's a plus -- the Oman Dive Center, just 25 minutes from downtown Muscat, is one of the best scuba operations we have reviewed anywhere in the world.)  &nbsp;This new multi-million-dollar complex spans a pristine white sand cove, is crisply managed, safety conscious &amp; friendly. &nbsp; Please check our 10 detailed articles on Arabian Sea vacations in the Gulf of Oman. &nbsp;  There's SO much more than scuba diving when you plan dive trips in Oman:  namely world-class caving, canyon trekking, desert camping, oasis hiking, exploring ancient forts &amp; some of the best market shopping anywhere in Asia. &nbsp; This beautiful nation has to be seen to be fully appreciated. &nbsp;  Yes, we recommend Oman diving with enthusiasm.  &nbsp;  Oh, &amp; did we mention -- after weeks in Oman on our first reconaissance tour, we learned with confidence that there's no threat from Islamic fundamentalism. &nbsp; Oman is the Switzerland of the Arab world, with none of the reactionary excesses of some neighboring  states.  No worries on that score; this will be a dive tour sans hassles.  This is an Arab country where women drive cars &amp; run companies &amp; where foreigners are welcomed warmly, right from the get-go.  Give the exotica of Oman diving a whirl!  Our founder, John Hessburg, enjoyed Oman thoroughly -- the people as much as the geography.  Oman dive trips are mega-fun, folks, we will vouch for that.</P>

U.S. Dive Travel now is offering customized Yap dive vacations for any clients who book the Star Dancer in Palau, or the Truk Aggressor, or Palau Aggressor; &amp; also neighbor islands in Micronesia such as Kosrae &amp; Pohnpei. You can add some action-packed days on the legendary isle of Yap, where for centuries natives used huge circular stones, like massive rock donuts, for currency. This island is well-known for gracious &amp; hospitable people, plus schools of huge manta rays that will amaze you as they sweep past your dive group like a B2 bomber squadron on full after-burn. Yap is one magical &amp; innocent island, funseekers.  For years our group guides &amp; clients have reported back to us that some of these rays come in schools of 7 - 10 huge critters, some grand-daddys with wingspans more than 12-14 feet wide! This is a breath-taking experience that can be found only in Yap &amp; a few other locations worldwide.  Yap dive vacations at Manta Ray Bay Hotel = teeming manta rays + streaming rays (solar that is).  The Yap Magic of Manta Ray Bay is pure &amp; simple, <I>amigos del mar</I>.</P>

Kungkungan Bay Resort is an upscale, comfortably elegant dive resort

You know, that's the enormous Indonesian island with a shape like some windblown "Special K" 
cereal box logo, located smack dab in the center of the sweeping Indonesian archipelago.  
Kungkungan Bay Resort is right on the well-touted Lembeh Strait, which many dive tour guides in 
this country consider one of the finest macro-photography &amp; critter diving destinations 
in a world weary of superlatives.  The Kungkungan Bay Resort staff likes to say, "We're so sure you'll locate 
what you're looking for here, that if you can't find your favorite ocean critter here, it probably 
doesn't exist!"  Now THAT's what we call solid Critter Confidence on any dive tour.  These dive tours to Indonesia create 
lasting memories that invigorate the spirit for decades to come.  Dive Trip your way to Oceanic Serenity, amigos.

Savvy Caribbean guides regard Lions Dive Hotel as, hands down, the best-value 3-star hotel on this fun Dutch island.
