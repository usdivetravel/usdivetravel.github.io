</FONT><P>Are Tamanu Beach Hotel has a history going back hundreds of years. Like all lands in the Cook Islands, the land Are Tamanu Beach Hotel is built upon bears the traditional name 'Are Tamanu'. The literal translation of Are Tamanu -- in the Maori dialect of Rarotonga -- is 'house of the mahogony tree'. In keeping with its traditional name, this hotel's 12 luxury self-catering and individual bungalows feature classicly honed Tamanu wood floors and Cook Island style thatched roofs. Tamanu wood is also used in the carvings in each room and the stunning poolside bar. Are Tamanu is a family owned hotel operated with a strong sense of tradition, pride and family values. We invite you to sample a taste of our Cook Island hospitality, on-line. Kia Orana, e Kia Manuia! (Welcome &amp; blessings to you -- from everyone at Are Tamanu Resort !) </P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><P>LOCATION of ARE TAMANU RESORT</FONT>:<br>
</B>Situated in one of the most scenic corners of the South Pacific, Aitutaki atoll lies 225km to the North of Rarotonga, the capital of the Cook Islands. The Aitutaki lagoon is without a doubt one of the Cook Islands most stunning assets. The aqua marine lagoon hosts abundant marine life as well as the 'motu', tiny uninhabited islands of white sand beaches and gleaming coconut palms. Are Tamanu Beach Hotel is situated on the Western side of Aitutaki, offering superb sunset viewing from the poolside bar. The private white sand beach of Are Tamanu Resort borders Aitutaki's crystal clear lagoon providing endless opportunities for swimming, canoeing & Aitutaki snorkeling vacations.<BR><BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">HOW to REACH AITUTAKI LAGOON</FONT>:<BR>
</B>A short plane ride from Rarotonga with the domestic airline Air Rarotonga will bring you above some of the most gorgeous South Pacific atolls extant to this  friendly island, where you will be welcomed with typical Aitutaki hospitality, a flower 'ei' (necklace) and genuine smile. Air Rarotonga operates regular Saab 340 flights six days a week.  Therefore, Aitutaki snorkeling vacations are exotic yet quite accessible.</P>

<BR>

</B><FONT SIZE=2><P>(The following article is by John Hessburg, general manager of U.S. Dive Travel Network.)</P></font>


<P>Here's where the whole adventure started for the owners of U.S. Dive

Travel -- Susan & John Hessburg. Until they first visited the Cook

Islands in 1990 for their honeymoon, each had been slogging through the

9-to-5 corporate trenches for years. After a good stay in this hospitable South Pacific island

nation, where the vistas both topside &amp; underwater were healing &amp;

inspiring, John returned to the United States &amp; a few months later

dropped his 15 year career as a journalist to found this dive travel company.

Susan followed suit a little later &amp; the rest is happy history. As

John &amp; Susan like to recall, &quot;If it weren't for the Cook Islands,

we'd still be punching the clock &amp; sweating the small stuff.&quot;

These enchanting South Pacific atolls seem to have been hand-crafted by the Creator

for three reasons: to dissolve stress, to stimulate creativity, &amp; to

refresh weary hearts &amp; minds.</P>



<P>What's more, the pristine power of the Cook Islands, the magic of the

reefs, mountains, deep green jungles, sunny beaches, lagoons &amp; sweet-spirited

people have not dimmed a bit. In fact, this remote island haven, like a

venerable Pinot Noir, seems to grow mellower &amp; more fragrant with time.

Aitutaki Atoll & the Cook Islands will change you deep inside, if you let them.</P>




<P>U.S. Dive Travel represents most of the major hotels, lodges, guest

houses &amp; inns in the Cook Islands. We offer remarkable wholesaler bargains

on seven of the 15 main islands. Here in this website, however, we'll

focus on the best-value lodging &amp; diving options on each of the two

most popular islands: Aitutaki Atoll & Rarotonga.</P>



<hr><BR>



<P>First, let's visit the Aitutaki Atoll, which most travelers visit after

a relaxing stay on the main island of Rarotonga. The Cook Islands' capital

isle, Rarotonga, is located about 2,942 miles due south of Honolulu, Hawaii

&amp; is easily reached from the U.S. West Coast via Hawaii in a mellow

day's journey from Los Angeles. Aitutaki Atoll  is only about 140 miles to the

North of Rarotonga -- less than an hour by twin-engine island hopper. The

view as you descend over Aitutaki Atoll is something you won't forget for the

rest of your life.</P>



<P>The colors of Aitutaki Lagoon are like surreal cinema. This vast liquid

jewel begs you to plunge in and embrace it, to absorb youth and health

from it. The lagoon's hue slides from slate gray to iridescent robin's

egg blue to hypnotic turquoise, all in a lazy synchrony with the pas de

deux of sun and clouds. The brilliant ocean colors, which shift subtly

hour by hour as the sun arcs higher, then lower in the sky, then behind

clouds, are so perfect, so intense, that many people sit on the shore &amp;

stare for hours, engulfed in quiet pleasure, dreaming the meditative daydreams

of children. Aitutaki Lagoon gleams &amp; glimmers with colors that not

even Velvia film &amp; Leica lenses can capture exactly. Each time you

sweep your eyes across this glittering blend of aquamarine, emerald, azure,

royal blue, celeste &amp; blue topaz -- with some other strange extraterrestrial

glint that defies definition -- you want to tear off your shirt &amp; cannonball

off the nearest jetty. You feel the need to wrap this living color up in

your arms &amp; take it home with you. The color, the color, it's the color.....it's

wild, fresh, magnificent, free. And it only gets better when you don a

diving mask &amp; slip under the bath-warm waves to swim around the corals

&amp; the scores of sleek little denizens they shelter.</P>



<P>Peace is the currency of workaday life, on all Aitutaki snorkeling vacations, here in the South Pacific -- marrow-deep peace, easy

joy. These gracious people won't even take tips from you. That's an insult

here in the Cook Islands.  Aitutaki snorkeling vacations are about letting it slide, glide & roll with the tide.</P>



<P>Adventure guides &amp; authors who know the Pacific Rim have lauded

Aitutaki Lagoon as one of the world's most beautiful lagoons. After more than a score of trips to Polynesia 

since 1990, we assure you there's not a bit of hyperbole

to those writers' claims. Atolls do not come any prettier than this, at least on this planet.</P>



<P>The Aitutaki Lagoon Resort, a comfortable yet rustic place with delicious

buffet meals, is by all accounts the best property on the atoll. We recommend

it with enthusiasm. The resort features one of the cleanest white-sand

beaches on the island, plus a wonderful pool, bar, restaurant, live entertainment,

scooter rentals, canoes &amp; kayaks, sailing &amp; windsurfing, nearby

golf, fishing &amp; snorkeling, volleyball, &amp; a wealth of island cultural

&amp; back-country side tours.</P>



<P>Aitutaki Lagoon Resort is organized in a row of secluded old-fashioned

beach bungalows, some with thatched roofs, all with simple Polynesian decor

that sets you at ease the moment you enter. Just the scent of the sea breezes,

the fresh flowers &amp; jungle plants nearby, the clean wood of the huts,

seems to stir peace &amp; romance in a tired heart. </P>



<P>Meanwhile, Aitutaki Scuba Ltd, run by the affable Neil Mitchell with

his inflatable raft, is a safe, reliable dive operation that will show

you a fine time. For nominal rates, non-diving snorkelers can book a seat

on a spacious pontoon boat with renowned reef guide Ria Emil, for an exciting

half-day tour to the perimeter of Aitutaki Atoll, where the coralheads

will drain every last drop of stress from your frame. Your guides will

spear a fine mess of reef fish, then whisk you out to one of a pearl-strand

of uninhabited motus (little isles on the atoll rim) for an old-time fish

fry on white sandy beaches lined with coconut palms. Talk about living

large in the South Pacific.  Now while Aitutaki snorkeling is splendid; the fact is 

scuba diving here is nothing to write home to Mom about, certainly not the 

<I>sine qua non </I>of Polynesian scuba diving.

But the fresh cleanliness of these reefs, & the dance of life on the smaller bommies 

inside the atoll rim, are well worth the donning of scuba diving gear.
</P>



<P>A marvelous array of sea critters are dwelling in the reefs around Rarotonga

&amp; Aitutaki Atoll, especially hordes of small, skittery luminescent fish such

as parrotfish, triggerfish, eels, &amp; a wealth of wrasses, fusiliers,

sergeant majors &amp; other multi-colored tropical beauties. There are

scores of lustrous hard coral &amp; tiny fish species, plus slowpoke nudibranchs

&amp; giant clams with iridescent purple lips that shimmer like the running

lights of flying saucers. This Cook Island reef life that girdles Aitutaki Lagoon & 
Rarotonga island is enough to start the hearts

of even the most city-frazzled folks.</P>



<P>The marine life is beautiful &amp; so are the people of the Cook Islands. Gracious, peaceful,

full of laughter &amp; shy humility, the men, women &amp; children of the

Aitutaki & Rarotonga are also uncommonly attractive. They are graced with chestnut-cinnamon

skin, dark flashing eyes &amp; smiles broad enough to light up a room.

It's great fun to just hang loose with these people, sipping a soda &amp;

talking story, glancing now &amp; again at the susurrating waves. After

a few days on Aitutaki Atoll you'll forget that time, pomp &amp; circumstance

ever had any meaning. This is a wonderful South Pacific island to help ease you back

to the basics -- health, humor &amp; tranquility. </P>


<hr><BR>



<P>Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry of the Cook Islands tossed a wry little

parable into a speech he gave in Honolulu a few years back. He told of

meeting a lovestruck British couple who chose New Caledonia in the South

Pacific for their honeymoon. &quot;We were told,&quot; they enthused, &quot;that

New Caledonia is the closest place to heaven.&quot; Mr. Henry said they

had been misled. If proximity to Paradise was their mission, he said, they

should have honeymooned in Tahiti. That, the chief of state insisted, &quot;is

the closest place in the South Pacific to the Cook Islands. And the Cook Islands are heaven.&quot;</P>

Further, a riot of local thugs in Papeete, Tahiti, burned down much of their main airport a few years back, so who needs Tahiti?  Fact is, many local people on Tahiti island, unless you speak perfect French, are more than likely to ignore you, yawn in your face or turn away, as supremely indifferent to your vacation needs as a Siamese cat with dyspepsia.  The Cook Islands have everything Tahiti used to have, with virtually none of the aloofness to foreigners, nor the inflated prices.  Forget Tahiti folks, the Cook Islands are a cheaper, kinder alternative, pure & simple.  And that goes for Bora Bora & Moorea, too.  While the Tuamotus are much friendlier to outsiders, & offer vastly better diving opportunities; Tahiti = expensive cold shoulder;  the Cook Islands = affordable friendly hospitality.</FONT><BR>




<P>To label any South Pacific island &quot;Paradise&quot; is a risible cliche

in the New Millennium, especially for some place as oversold as Tahiti, yet the Cook Islands not only fit that bill, they transcend

guidebook clich&eacute;s. The otherworldly beauty of these Polynesian islands recalls

the past purity of Hawaii's Neighbor Islands &amp; or the once brilliant Tahiti before World

War II. The Polynesian people are kind &amp; quiet, the climate ideal, the air redolent

of perpetual spring, the seafood &amp; tropical fruits delicious. Service

is crisp, accommodations affordable. We have asked ourselves hundreds of

times whether it's even right to sell these sacred islands, to facilitate

the flow of foreigners out here, where years of curious footsteps might

spoil a way of life that's vanishing on our small planet.</P>



<P>So far our worries are unfounded. The true, the good &amp; the beautiful

endure. But it's only a matter of time before the traveling cognoscenti

of North America, Japan, Europe &amp; Australia discover these South Pacific

gems and the secret is out for good. The Cook Islands are destined to be

a destination. Only the Second Coming could change that. </P>



<P>Here are more reasons why we love the Cook Islands: gyrating folk dancers reputed

to be the wildest in the South Pacific; ancient landlocked coral reefs

called <I>makatea</I>, with their razor-sharp ridges and huge uncharted caves;

and clandestine male-bonding bashes called <I>tumunu</I>, where the boisterous

gab is fueled by stout orange wine that's brewed in hollow palm stumps.

What's more, there is the amorous free-for-all of faraway Pukapuka island's

annual &quot;Sadie Hawkins-style&quot; jubilee. Imagine this: young women

are given traditional license to vent their hottest passions free of any

public censure. For several days the women chase down any single men they desire like

love quarry; then have their way with the barely protesting gents. Amazing, but it's true. 

The girls hunt the boys &amp; the

boys flee like hell. Heaven help you, buddy, if the ladies catch you.</P>



<P>There are no poisonous insects or animals on land in the Cook Islands,

nor malaria nor serious tropical diseases. In fact, on Aitutaki there isn't

even one dog to bark &amp; bother you; only a wandering tribe of skinny

feral cats that skulk around the resort perimeters like gremlins on high-test

espresso. There are no traffic jams; there's no smog, no city chaos, no

buildings higher than a palm tree; &amp; you can rent putt-putt motor bikes

for a song, to tool around the islands. Voltage is 230 on a 50 DC cycle,

the same as Australia &amp; New Zealand. The Cook Island dollar is pegged

to the Kiwi buck; &amp; your U.S. dollars go a long, long way down here.

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT>

<P>All Aitutaki Lagoon dive package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging & diving prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; & that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our Aitutaki Lagoon vacation experts normally secure wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals. </P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these Aitutaki Lagoon snorkeling packages show prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At most Aitutaki Lagoon resorts, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International &amp; commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $35 per person for the land portion + $20 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients to Aitutaki Atoll may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. Solo clients will always pay a single supplement to secure a private room -- normally 35% to 50% more -- &amp; possibly a full doubling of the standard double-occupancy rate at some dive resorts.</P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for typical Aitutaki Atoll dive resorts & side tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest & our prices the lowest in this industry, & thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa & Mastercard. For ultra-discount wholesale air tickets to Aitutaki Atoll , USDT accepts only cashier's checks or wire transfers, please.</P>

<P>Remember, all Aitutaki Atoll  vacation clients will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $25 - $40 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; & away you go. Best of luck with your dive travel plans. We hope your scuba diving vacation is a safe & satisfying adventure. Blessings & best wishes with ALL your snorkeling vacations on Aitutaki Atoll.</P>

<P>Best fishes too!</P>
