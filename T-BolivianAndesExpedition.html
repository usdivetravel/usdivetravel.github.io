Leader of the 1989 U.S. Expedition to Bolivia's Cordillera Real', John Hessburg gives thanks for perfect weather & ideal snow conditions, <BR>
at 16,200' high camp (Camp Susana) beneath the wind-swept summit of Mt. Chachacomani, 19,902 feet.  Five Americans on that team<BR>
reached both summits of Chachacomani, completing a first ascent of the elusive Northeast Ridge, which dominates the icefalls below.<BR>

of <st1:City w:st="on">Edmonds</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">WA</st1:State>,
one of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">America</st1:country-region></st1:place>'s
top session guitarists from the 1960's through the 1980's.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Howard, who became one of my dearest friends
in the Emerald City of Seattle, had played on more than 50,000 singles, jingles
&amp; TV commercials.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He backed up
Elvis, the Stones, the Beach Boys, plus he laid down monster guitar tracks for
dozens of hit rock tunes &amp; pop-culture classics like "Shadow of Your
Smile."<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>Howard
Roberts, whom we nicknamed "The Phant" (for Phantom) is the man who played that
rollicking "needle-needle neet-not" intro to the 1960's classic Beverly
Hillbillies TV theme.</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also played
the eerily unforgettable "dee-dee dah-dah" licks that started Rod Serling's
original Twilight Zone show. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

margin-left:10.5pt;tab-stops:6.0in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Howard was
one amazing gent, &amp; I deeply admired his casual outlook on urban life, the
way he relaxed 120% in his art form, avoiding social pressures &amp; status
symbols like they were leprosy lesions.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Good ol' Howard Roberts, he praised the crazy energies of playing guitar,
actually doing anything you love to do -- in &quot;Real Time.&quot; That was
his label for an almost sacred state of mind that comes when you shuck the
workaday world of worry, competition &amp; striving to achieve.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Instead you reach for humor, creative
exploration &amp; free-floating improv.  Kind of like kids playing on a tropical beach while their parents look the other way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

margin-left:10.5pt;tab-stops:6.0in'><span style='font-size:14.0pt'>Intrigued,
inspired by Howard's artistic freedom, I therefore resolved that this
expedition's goal would be to have no rigid goals at all -- we'd go
&quot;Climbin' in Real Time&quot; -- &amp; nuts to the noise of Madison Avenue.
The idea was for seven guys to jump headfirst into an alpine jam session, & see where it led.  &quot;Climbin' in Real Time&quot; would be spontaneous, impish, childlike yet bold & colorful like Aurora Borealis, the Northern Lights, which as we all know are "what rainbows do when the teacher leaves the room," to quote my best adventure buddy Bob Shaw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we dragged those bags, one by one, to a higher plateau, <span class=GramE>then</span>

And Pete got Nevado Domine's toughest crux named after him -- the Delmissier Step -- a tricky 25-foot stretch of nearly vertical ice framed below by a yawning crevasse that was, well, a bit deeper than we'd hoped for when scanning it from high camp with "binocks."  When I kicked an ice clump down, it was a good five seconds before we heard a clunk.  OK, take a deep breath, suck it up.  Everything's gonna be OK.  And it was because we went carefully, step by deliberate step.  Over & over all day long & well into the night.  Step by deliberate step ...<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

We all had wives, girlfriends, families back in the USA who mattered way more than another notch on our ice axes. Then we called it a trip, left Chekap Kuchu &amp; began the grinding 3-day
march back to Jankho Khota village. We herded those rowdy llamas back to their home corrals, paid the herdsmen & gave them gifts, returned to La Paz, hurled ourselves at

But during that aching period of adjustment something good was happening in parallel.  That was when confidence started to bloom like a century plant.  Big fun ideas, wonderful thoughts of a new career, the hopes of marrying Susan soon then starting a new adventure vector.  I suggested we honeymoon in the Rocky Mountains, maybe Colorado right after a March wedding. <BR><BR> 

"Hey Sooz the ice conditions can be great in March & think how we can ski into base camp!  It'll be sooo cool!" <BR><BR>

Susie narrowed her eyes to slits, pressed her lips for emphasis, & lobbied inexorably for her native island of Oahu, then the South Pacific. She never gave up.  "But Susie," I griped, "the Pacific will be so rainy & hot that time of year.  Who needs all that tacky humidity?  Yecchhh... let's go some place clean & craggy.  C'mon hon' let's visit the Rockies for our honeymoon!  You'll love it."<BR><BR>

Susan's reluctance was more soul-driven, more persistent than 20 llamas at the rockslide.  Day after day the Rockies were pounded, battered, buffeted by the South Pacific.  Susie had lived for 20+ years on Oahu & she was adamant.  Uninformed, misguided, I resisted for weeks like a rebellious, er, mule.  Then in March of 1990 we got married -- most of Real Timers made it to the wedding -- & wouldn't you know it, we ended up honeymooning in Hawaii & the Cook Islands for a splendiferous month of sunshine, surf & sand.  Susie had won the pre-nup tug-o-war, hands down.<BR><BR>

No, actually, we both did .... a few months later, buoyed by an astonishingly good time on Rarotonga & Aitutaki islands, I was smitten by the SoPac forever & decided to make the Pacific our workplace & the Rockies our playground.  Somehow, after the Perfect Trip to Chachacomani in Bolivia, we both knew U.S. Dive Travel would be blessed from its toddlin' days.  And it was mates, it really was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the North Cascades, picking the Coleman Glacier Route on Mt. Baker's southern flanks.  Just ahead on the glacier, next<BR>
to a gaping deep bergschrund (crevasse) John proposed marriage to Susie.  She said yes & the wheels of goodwill began<BR>
to turn, inexorably, that led to founding U.S. Dive Travel.  John still jokes about the location choice for his proposal -- right<BR>
next to that big crevasse. "If she said no, that was a convenient spot to tip over & disappear into the icy bowels of Mt. Baker!"<BR>

<P>All vacation package prices from U.S. Dive Travel Network are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging, side tour &amp; diving prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard per FAA rules. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our tropical vacation experts normally secure excellent wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated all U.S.-based airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals.  Early is good when seeking the best air ticket rates.</P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above scuba diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At many dive resorts, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International air tickets &amp; commuter "island-hopper" seats are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $55 per person for the land portion + $35 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts.</P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for all of our dive resorts, side tours &amp; air ticket specials is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer only. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest &amp; our prices the lowest in this industry, &amp; thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard.</P>

<P>Once again a friendly reminder, if you want to dig further into these topics: Andes Mountains, Andes mountaineering, Andes alpinism, Andes climbing, Bolivian Andes, Cordillera Real, 1989 Real Time Expedition, Bolivia climbing, Bolivia mountaineering, Bolivia expeditions -- please feel free to call us any time!  </P>
