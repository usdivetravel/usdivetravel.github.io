<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">OK, take a break; it's time for a tropical riddle.
What do Tuesday night TV, Thanksgiving dinner with the folks &amp; Hawaii
scuba diving -- also Hawaii snorkeling & Hawaii beach vacations -- all have in common?</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Four words, funseekers.
They're all: predictable, close, lively &amp; cheap. Cheap entertainment,
that is. </P>

And that is the refreshing undercurrent of diving, snorkeling, surfing or lolly-gagging beachside in the Hawaiian Islands.
Whether by boat or by shore, the scuba diving, the mellow snorkeling, & the beach basking in this oft under-rated archipelago are:</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">PREDICTABLE -- If you stick with 
heads-up surge technique, respect the dive tables &amp; avoid deep pocket coves
in big water, your safety is virtually guaranteed. You won't get to wallow amongst 
vast billowy corals anywhere, but you're likely to enjoy some big critter encounters,
from muscular whitetip sharks to curious, serenely gliding green sea turtles to dozens of gaping
moray eels, who sway from their crannies like cobras charmed by some sea
swami.  Hotels & resorts on these Neighbor Islands are on their toes these days, & clients report to us that customer 
service is at an all-time high, while prices have been pared back nearly to the 1990s in special locales.  Hawaii beach vacations, Hawaii snorkeling trips, Hawaii scuba diving vacations now offer some of the sweetest bargains on the travel planet.  Susan & I will vouch for this: we've been blessed to visit the Hawaiian Islands 24 times since 1990, for more than 3 dozen unique island visits, some as long as 6 weeks a stay.  And we still can't get enough of this magnificent island chain.  Hawaii diving, Hawaii snorkeling, Hawaii waves get into your blood, friends, & that heady feeling  just keeps calling you back like some seductive Siren song.</FONT> </FONT></B></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">CLOSE -- If you live anywhere
West of Denver, flight times &amp; fares to Hawaii are duck soup. The Honolulu
hub is about 5 &frac12; hours from L.A. or Seattle, only 5 hours from San
Francisco. Then it's just a quick hop to the Neighbor Islands: only about 41
minutes to Kona, or 35 minutes to Kauai or Maui.  Hawaiian Airlines & Delta Northwest offer random specials that sometimes seem astonishing for their sheer value.  Even from landlocked Minneapolis, we can easily grab non-stop e-tix for the low $800's, round-trip, with careful planning & a ready speed-dial finger.  Non-stop flights on Delta NW from the Twin Cities, Chicago & other heartland cities can take as little as 8+ hours outbound & less than 7 hours return!  Thanks to the cool new breed of Boeing & AirBus birds, these flights are streamlined delightful zippety-doo's.</FONT> </FONT></B></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">LIVELY -- If you like scores
of small critters lurking in compact coralheads, Hawaii is the ticket.
Don't forget about the grinning sea turtles, big as 18-wheeler hubcaps, who glide
by so close to your mask they nearly lobby you to Save the Whales.  Waikiki Beach on Oahu may be a tourist magnet, but it's big-time fun for folks learning to longboard surf, or who just want a great beach escape by day, superb eats by night & endless affordable entertainment.  Windward Oahu & West Maui offer some of the world's most unspoiled, breath-takingly lovely beaches.  Our frame of reference is solid.  Having spent several years, cumulatively, in 30+ tropical island countries around the world since the 1970s, we never have found any beaches that can beat the gems of windward Oahu & West Maui.  The Hawaiian Islands are a bone fide American treasure.</FONT>
</FONT></B></LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">CHEAP -- If you scoot with early deposits, you can beat the airlines' pricing games.
Find a reliable dive travel wholesaler who knows these islands well.  Never buy air tix 
at exorbitant published fares if you can avoid it &amp; travel during low seasons.
That means Christmas, Thanksgiving &amp; Spring Break are war zones, amigos.  We have found beautiful, sweet-spirited little family-run hotels on Maui & the Kona Coast that still come in well south of $200 a night.  The deals are there, & we can help you find them, in short order.
One thing though .... if you hazard a Kona booking during the annual Ironman Triathlon in
October, you'll find rooms on the Big Island as abundant as consciences
in a school of tiger sharks. </FONT> </FONT></B></LI>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Shark-bashing aside, consider
the myopic myth that Hawaii diving is ho-hum, just because it is not the
Red Sea, Papua New Guinea or Fiji. Would you feel less alive on a coastal
highway, on a perfectly sunny day, if you were powering a navy blue mini-van
into the 'S' curves, instead of a brand-new flaming red Corvette? </FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">If your honest answer is
yes, please read no further. Sorry amigo, your maritime appetites are way too exotic for Hawaii vacations.
Now, for the rest of us happy working stiffs, here's a little reality check.
It's true that virtually none of the Hawaiian shores offer the same mind-expanding
lushness of Fijian corals, nor the flamboyant diversity of rare reef species
in Papua New Guinea.  But so what?  Vacations need not be like edgy "reality TV", always reaching for the next EXTREME this or MEGA that.  Sometimes aren't vacations supposed to be about, well, just VACATING?  (Vacating the brain of stress & gritty city living, right?)  OK, are we rollin' along together?  Great, let's keeping movin' in true Aloha Spirit ...</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Next issue: this lame stereotype
of &quot;Hawaii as Waikiki&quot; -- let's pound that one into the sand,
6 feet under. Hawaii is SO much more than loud aloha shirts &amp; sunset  
grass-skirt dance revues.  While thousands of good people each year really have a blast in Honolulu, there is more to see in the Neighbor Islands, sunseekers.  Let's set aside the Madison Avenue imagery.  Instead, here is what Hawaii vacations ARE, what Hawaii diving IS, &amp;
most of our local Neighbor Island friends agree:</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>


<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The eerie, convoluted shapes
of lava tubes &amp; the myriad sprightly species they shelter. These ancient
lava flows have been worn into archways, collapsed tunnels &amp; rocky
runnels that jut underwater from the shores of West Maui, South Lanai,
the Kona Coast &amp; South Kauai, to name a few locales. The countless
nooks, slots &amp; grottoes inside these lava flows - called <I>pukas</I>
by the locals -- are cool little condos for countless species from night-flitting
octopi &amp; pufferfish to squirrelfish, bizarre crabs &amp; brilliant
sea stars.</FONT> </FONT></B></LI>
</UL>


<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The healthiest &amp; most
playful sea turtles you're likely to see anywhere in Polynesia, especially
off the shores of South Kauai, Southwest Maui &amp; the Kona Coast (southwest
flank of Hawaii, &quot;The Big Island.&quot;) I'll never forget that old
three-legged green turtle, who for years regaled divers off Kauai's southern
shores. The locals called him &quot;Tripod.&quot; Seems a nasty whitetip
chomped him once. I really hope he's still around, &amp; not a Bipod today.</FONT>
</FONT></B></LI>
</UL>


<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The scores of curious,
mouthy moray eels - yellow margins, snowflakes &amp; whitemouths - that
seem to rule these reefs like nosy washroom narcs in Singapore. Morays,
morays, &amp; more rays - than you can count in a lifetime - that is Hawaii scuba 
diving. </FONT></FONT></B></LI>
</UL>


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">My favorite greeting to
scuba newbies in Hawaii is to lampoon that old Dean Martin song, &quot;When
the moon hits your eye, like a big pizza pie... '' The parody goes: &quot;Put
your hand in a crack, if you don't get it back, it's a moray ...If it's toothy & brown &amp; it's dragging you down, it's a moray...&quot;
That's <I>one </I>way to get the &quot;Don't-Touch-Don't-Filch&quot; eco-message
across in Hawaii diving circles.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Let's move on. We dive Hawaii
because it's there -- pure &amp; simple. Hawaii diving is a reliable alternative
to that sinus-searing jolt -- you know, the mammal diving reflex --
when you first plant your face in the way-cooooold water of Monterey, Catalina,
Puget Sound or the Jersey shores. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">I'll concede that Hawaii
diving is less like some Peter Max vista from Yellow Submarine &amp; more
like a sere Mexican high desert transplanted underwater. Still, this is
a fun &amp; fascinating world, self-contained, beautiful in its own right.
And it sure beats muck diving in bone-cold mainland lakes with 10-foot
&quot;viz,&quot; mummified in a 7-mill wetsuit that chafes you where tropical
sun jess don' shine. </FONT></FONT></B></P>


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Despite the intrusions of
mainland culture, in one very literal sense, Hawaii scuba diving is still exotic &amp;
remote. Remember that the Hawaiian Island chain is actually the northern
apex of the Polynesian Triangle, also bounded by Easter Island &amp; New
Zealand. The state of Hawaii is the most remote island cluster -- furthest
from any continental land mass -- of any Pacific island chain. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

of HAWAIIAN ISLES !<BR>
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The official Hawaiian Archipelago,
as depicted on Pacific charts, encompasses more than 130 islands, some
just random rocky pinnacles. The Hawaiian Island chain sprawls westward
from the Big Island, more than 1,500 miles, past even Midway Island, all
the way out to Kure Atoll. Old Hawaiian fishermen &amp; charter skippers,
whom I've interviewed, say that from Niihau westward to Midway Island you'll
find some of the wildest, most shark-rich waters in the Pacific.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">My wife Susan was blessed to grow up on windward Oahu, in a lovely
seaside village near Kailua, where she lived two decades & change. Now, after many 
lively visits since 1990, to seven of Hawaii's eight Neighbor Islands,
we have acquired a keen taste for free diving &amp; scuba diving on Niihau,
Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui &amp; the Big Island. We have a sense
of how the winds &amp; waves will treat us, no matter what month we show
up.   The more we see, the more we know we have missed.  It feels we are just beginning to understand  
the deep soul of these wonderful isles after crossing the 
Big Blue more than 24 times from the mainland since 
1990 to relish the Hawaiian scuba diving, free diving, mountain hiking, 
beach ramblin', boogie boarding & scores of photo treks.  Hawaii diving never seems to disappoint us.<BR>
<BR>
Caring for these magical islands is not unlike being parents of seven spirited
&amp; precocious children. You really have no favorites -- only alternate
delights. Sometimes, some days, you just want to hang with one kid a little more than
another. No reason, just whimsy. Every day is different. No politics, just
the drifty breezy vagaries of &quot;mana ohana&quot; -- Hawaiian family
spirit. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>NI'IHAU &amp; KAUA'I:<BR>
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We love Ni'ihau for its edgy wilderness
feel, it's brooding mystery &amp; its effulgent reef life. We love Niihau's
sister island, Kauai, for its magnificent Waimea Canyon vistas, its spiritually
arousing 12 miles of Na Pali Coast Trail &amp; the dynamic daily coral
&amp; critter surprises of South Shore diving.  Ni'ihau diving is almost a sacred experience.
Kauai diving offers heart-starting currents &amp; critter surprises.  Ni'ihau diving is 
Hawaii's ultimate gift to the scuba diving world.

</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We love Oahu for a few great little
secret shore dives we've collected over the years, &amp; for the healing
beauty of the Ko'olau Mountains, for the stunning hidden beaches of perfect
sugar sand we have discovered, for some of the finest long running beaches
in the Pacific, &amp; for the beatiful &quot;hapa-haole&quot; children
of this island, who are a healthy meld of so many Polynesian, Asian &amp;
American family roots. The World Look of exotic racial mixes is ultra-hip
among New York fashion circles now, &amp; Oahu has had this chic gene pool
in full swing for more than a century.  In fact, after about 50 extended visits to island groups across the Pacific, we feel the people & culture of Oahu, the eye-candy beaches of Oahu, still rank among the most movingly beautiful in the world.  Then there are the healthy & fascinating reefs.  Granted, Oahu diving is not brilliant, but it sure is a gas.  It sure is relaxing, entertaining & visually rewarding.  
And because Oahu diving is so accessible to mainlanders,  it's a great value, too.<BR>

of the Kola Mountains, the laid-back Big Easy feeling of Old Lahaina Town,
the quasi-baronial splendor of the hotels on the Kaanapali &amp; Wailea
coasts, the venerable winding road to Hana with its heart-starting cliffside
vistas (&amp; dropoffs!), the great hulking volcano Haleakala (House of
the Sun), a 10,023-foot verdant behemoth that dominates the island's every
skyline; &amp; we love Maui diving for its awesome easy shore dives, its huge
friendly sea turtles &amp; the easy vessel access across the channel to
stellar South Shore Lanai diving.  Oahu &amp; Maui are still the most popular islands for Hawaii dive packages.
Maui diving is a double-shot of life &amp; color.  Maui diving is well worth the trip.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>MOLOKA'I:<BR>
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">We love Moloka'i for its compelling
history of the modern saint Father Damien &amp; his leper colony, for the
astonishing glory of the Halawa Valley waterfalls &amp; deep jungle trails on its eastern
flanks, &amp; for about 28 miles of kaleidoscopic virgin corals, steep
walls &amp; fish-rich crevices along the South Shore. If we ever move to
the Hawaiian Islands, this is the island that we'd look at first. Moloka'i
is one of the few truly unspoiled islands left in the Central Pacific --
a happy half century removed from the madness &amp; bustle of the Year
2,000.  Moloka'i diving means nearly pristine coral colonies &amp; huge lobsters by the scores.<BR>

Bay Hotel &amp; the Lodge at Koele, two of the most wonderful luxury hotels
we have seen anywhere on the planet, &amp; for Lanai's vast, vaulted underwater
caverns just exploding with frisky marine life. Lanai diving paints lifetime memories as deep as the 
gullies in your pocketbook.  But hey, what are dollars for, if not to enjoy?
Lanai diving is one atypical way to invest long green, we think.<BR>

after whom this great state was named, for its two 13,700-foot snowclad
volcanoes -- Mauna Kea &amp; Mauna Loa -- for its hundreds of miles of prime coastline vistas, for countless
pristine waterfalls that cascade off the mountains' Hilo-side flanks, for
the great turtle diving right near Kona Village, &amp; for the warm, familial
feel the locals impart to visitors. The Big Island &amp; Molokai are really
the most Polynesian &amp; old-fashioned of the Neighbor Islands,
where you'll still find abundant aloha spirit &amp; a relaxed
neighborly attitude almost everywhere you go. Kona diving is lava-tube satori.
Kona diving offers the best natural leeward shores in Hawaii.  Kona diving is easy &amp; fun.<BR>

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><FONT SIZE=+1>KAHO'OLAWE:<BR>
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Did we leave anybody out of our Big
Ohana? Darn right, we forgot Kaho'olawe, that bizarre old forgotten island
just off the southwestern flanks of Maui. For decades the U.S. military
has used poor Kaho'olawe as an ordnance sponge, a Ground Zero for
year after year of target practice -- battleship shelling &amp; warplane bombing
runs. Now the conventional wisdom is all that all you'd find
alive topside on Kaho'olawe are scruffy mesquite bushes &amp;
a few psychotic stumbling goats. Who knows?<BR>
<BR>
Only a few island people ever have set foot on this intriguing dusty island;
&amp; very few ever have scuba dived her shell-shocked flanks. Word has
it that a few stalwart Maui divers have slipped over to Kaho'olawe unnoticed
for some outstanding reef &amp; cavern diving, dodging the piles of deadly
live ordnance that litter the ocean floor everywhere. Some day we may mount
a diving expedition to Kaho'olawe, once the government opens it back up
to islanders. A few native Hawaiians are clamoring for Kaho'olawe to be
turned back over to the Hawaiian people, since they regard this island
as a sacred site. Stay tuned, funseekers of the strange &amp;
wild; we may have some Kaho'olawe diving news on the Hawaii scuba diving front in a year or
so.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

SEASONS in HAWAII:<BR>
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Barring weather aberrations, you normally
can count on the best diving conditions, on any island's leeward flanks,
from May through September. April &amp; October are fringe seasons when
it's pleasantly warm, but rain &amp; winds might be more frequent than
in summer. March can be one ripsnorting wind tunnel on several of the islands.
The rest of the winter is a toss of the dice for Hawaii dive travel.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Still, the November through
March period offers excellent diving options, if you avoid northern swells,
&amp; shorelines exposed to the heavy easterlies, &amp; if you seek the
vast volcano-shielded lees that Maui &amp; the Big Island offer. Because
it's a smaller, rounder island than its sisters, Kauai's seas can offer
some Maytag action in mid-winter, but your specie sightings are well worth
the churn.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">From November through March,
among our favorite shores for boat &amp; beach dives are Southwest Maui,
South Lanai &amp; the ever-reliable Kona Coast. There are many more primo
spots for Hawaii dive vacations, some so sacred to the locals that if we even mentioned them we'd
be, well, courting a stink-eye on our next trip. So we'll leave a little
to the imagination.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

JUSS DON' FO'GET YOU WETSUIT, BRADDAH!<BR>
</FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Imagination is cool, but in some Hawaii
diving matters, we need to be specific. Take staying warm for example.
Clients often ask us, &quot;Do I really need a 3-mill wetsuit for Hawaii?&quot;
The answer is a resounding &quot;yes!&quot; - unless you're gifted with
the high-rev metabolism of a spider monkey. All year around, summer &amp;
winter, we wear our trusty dusty 3-millimeter suits, ankles to neck &amp;
heck with the shorties. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The shallow water temps
in winter might dip to the mid-70s Fahrenheit on many islands; while summer
brings you the balmy seas in the high 70s to low 80s. The warmest water
we've ever experienced while Hawaii diving has been off West Maui in late summer.
There seems to be some mystical heat pocket out there, &amp; virtually
no thermoclines down to 60 feet at many dive sites. It's truly amazing.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<B>At long last, the shy little isle of Molokai is opening up soon for scuba diving vacations. And we are feeling stoked, funseekers, after waiting 20 years for this moment!  Molokai is so rarely visited by North American tourists, we sense a watershed moment here for serious snorkelers &amp; scuba divers, who like us are searching for something fresh, sweet-spirited &amp; untrampled, a little wild &amp; yet still comfy.  Visually compelling, spiritually invigorating, emotionally healing.  We call that a <I>"Tropidelic" </I>Hawaii vacation!  You can find something for everybody on Molokai -- scuba diving, snorkeling, mountain biking along 3,900-ft sea cliffs, archery, horseback riding, skeet shooting, serious hiking & mountain trekking, sea kayaking & cultural tours.  <P>


The original Sheraton <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">MOLOKAI RANCH LODGE</B></FONT>, is a classic hunting lodgy 4-star luxury getaway, with a huge Great Room &amp; massive log beams & buttresses, a chandelier &amp; wood paneling Robert Redford might envy in his mountain retreat. The crystal-clear pool, glowing green lawns &amp; indigenous-flora garden are something to behold, &amp; the meals are more art than cuisine. We were treated like <I>ohana</I> (family) by all the staff &amp; it felt so much like home after a few hours, we had to pry ourselves away to take the tours. <P>

There's also the new Sheraton <B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">KAUPOA BEACH CAMP</B></FONT>, is an astonishing place, unique in the Pacific -- a cushy tent-bungalow village on the wild west end of the island. There are 40 neatly built "tentalows" &amp; they are 100% comfortable, clean, right near the two pocket cove beaches. These sturdy high-walled canvas bungalows, stretched over aluminum frames, are built atop spacious wooden platforms with a bathroom, huge hotwater shower &amp; a private deck. The showers &amp; toilets are super-clean &amp; solar powered, designed impeccably for minimal impact on the earth. Honkin' big healthy wild turkeys strut the grounds like they own the place, &amp; rare Hawaiian monk seals flop around happily all over the beaches, wherever they feel like planting their blubber. This is stylish tropical camping, amigos, &amp; perfect for families with kids, big church groups, or a passel of dive shop buddies from Michigan. It's a cool new take on 21st century camping.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">In September of '92, Hurricane
Iniki lambasted Kauai, leveling homes, splintering boats &amp; smashing
most of what it touched. The island has staged a brilliant comeback. Hotels
are in fine form, dive guides are working hard &amp; the plant life is
bouncing back. There's still serious work to be done, but the worst is
over. Kauai is well worth the visit, just as it was pre-Iniki.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Locals boast that Mount
Waialeale, geologic core of Kauai, is the wettest place on Earth. Scientific
charts agree. Though the rain stays mainly in the island's center, it nurtures
incredibly lush verdure, flowers &amp; palms on all flanks of the highlands,
right down to the sea. This island is green beyond green.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The Na Pali Coast Trail,
on Kauai's NW shore, is about 12 miles of the most magnificent tropical
hiking I've ever seen anywhere in Polynesia. It's like a living poem to
purity from a past century.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The most reliable diving,
most of the year, is along Kauai's protected South Shore, from Poipu west
to about Port Allen. The corals &amp; fish are rebounding well from Iniki's
near kiss of death, according to instructor Kenny Bail, owner of Bubbles Below dive center, &amp; one of the most
respected veteran dive guides in the state. There are spicier reefs, for
certain, near Hanalei to the North (where celebrity sightings are a dime
a dozen) &amp; Barking Sands to the Southwest (don't even ask), but they
are simply harder to dive much of the year, due to fuel costs, exposure
to gnarly northern swell, &amp; brisk chop from periodic Kona winds.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">&quot;Unusual critters,
that's what Kauai is all about,&quot; says Mr. Niki Konstantinou, an ace underwater
photographer &amp; divemaster with Bubbles Below, who has studied Kauai dive sites for 15 years.
&quot;I feel the best single critter site in Hawaii is at Amber's Arches,
near Kauai's Southwest corner,&quot; he exults. &quot;It's a huge arch,
just painted on the ceiling with orange, yellow &amp; green cup corals.
The colors are fabulous! You regularly find frogfish, puffers, hairy hermits,
bi-colored anthias, ghost shrimp &amp; manta shrimp, plus dozens of slipper
lobsters &amp; big sponge crabs.&quot;</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Amber's Arches are dived
at about 55 to 75 feet, &amp; nearby is a cool cave, low-ceilinged &amp;
mysterious, that houses a couple healthy whitetip sharks. There also are
several large black coral trees with bristly turkeyfish lounging in their
branches, plus scads of long-nosed hawkfish. So what are you waiting for,

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>For decades Niihau (NEE-ee-how),
about 17 miles off the southwest coast of Kauai, has been strictly off-limits
to interlopers. No person can set foot on this island without special permission,
which rarely is granted by the island's owners. Mystery cloaks this strange
little isle, because it is tightly held by the reclusive Robinson clan
of Kauai, &amp; because Niihau is the last pure sanctuary of native Hawaiian
culture left in all of Polynesia. About 200 native Hawaiians still live
full-time on Niihau. They practice many of the ancient village customs
&amp; speak the time-honored musical tongue of pre-missionary Hawaii. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>For all these reasons, plus the
fact there are only a few months each year when the winds &amp; weather
permit a safe crossing, the scuba diving is ultra-virgin all around Niihau.
Some of the finest hard corals I've ever seen while Hawaii diving are common visual
treasures at Niihau. Best time to try a crossing of the formidable Kaulakahi
Channel is August or September. It's catch-as-catch-can. That makes the
forbidden fruit all the sweeter.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+O>Many popular Niihau dive sites
are in &amp; around a croissant-shaped volcanic crater called Lehua Rock,
which looms like a twin brother to Maui's Molokini Crater. Here you'll
sometimes find the elusive Hawaiian monk seal. Fewer than 1,000 such seals
are believed to survive today. Then there's the windward east-side areas
of Nenue Point, Stony River &amp; Pueo Point; &amp; also the fabulous South
Point dive. There are still acres of virgin reef to be explored around
the eastern shores &amp; the rarely visited west-side leeward sectors of
Nonopapa, Puuwai &amp; Opaniau. Ah, the sea spirits that must cavort out
there!</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Perhaps Kona's prime classic
site is Turtle Pinnacle, about a mile north of the main Kona Pier, &amp;
just a skosh from shore. Here you rarely get skunked on a turtle dive,
says Amanda Steenman, a cheerful &amp; savvy diving guide, &amp; former co-owner of Eco-Adventures dive center 
in Kailua-Kona, who figures
she's dived this site more than 200 times. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Here the Hawaiian green
sea turtles are typically smaller than the Goliaths of South Kauai, or
West Maui, but they are often more plentiful. While I've seen Mack Truck
male turtles on Maui that tipped the Toledos at about 250 lbs, here on
the Kona Coast you'll find them more in the 150-lb range. At Turtle Pinnacle,
the bottom is about 60 feet deep, with the pinnacle crest at 35 feet. What
makes this easy dive most fun is the fact it's a turtle-cleaning station.
&quot;I love seeing the interaction between turtles &amp; the little sergeant
majors &amp; tangs,&quot; Steenman says. &quot;Sometimes there are tons
of fish hovering over the turtles' shells&quot; - lunching gleefully on
parasites.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Another Kona Coast classic
is Kaiwi (Kah-EE-vee) Point, in the Pawai Bay area, about half a mile north
of the Kona Pier. &quot;It's a gorgeous dive, probably the best corals
on the island,&quot; Amanda says. &quot;There are lots of fish schools
&amp; a nice little archway.&quot; Dives here vary from 30 to 100 feet.
There's a little something for everybody, from novice to pro. &quot;One
time there were 4 or 5 spotted eagle rays in a group, just hanging around
us,&quot; Steenman recalls. That's something most divers wait a lifetime
to see. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">You can't reach these special
Kona sites for shore diving, because they are located just off protected
Hawaiian lands. That makes them a tad more alluring, Kona dive guides agree.
Now from daytime to night time delights we go. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The best night dive on the
Kona Coast, bar none, &amp; the Big Island's answer to Cayman's Stingray
City, is called Manta Madness, just off the Kona Surf Hotel point, south
of the village. This dive is in safe, shallow water; &amp; it's not uncommon
for half a dozen or more mantas to buzz you playfully for an hour, even
with a jumble of stunned divers flashing lamps like mad. This Hawaii diving classic is a
certifiable hoot.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">&quot;Once I was trying
to get an underwater photo &amp; I felt this nudge,&quot; Howeth remembers,
&quot;but I knew there was no surge. So I looked up &amp; my divers were
frantically pointing behind me, waving their arms. Then I turned &amp;
saw a sea turtle, 3 feet in diameter, scratching his shell on my tank valve!&quot;</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Howeth says he &amp; his
divemasters have a nearly 90% success ratio, usually 3 to 7 turtles at
a time, on their West Maui turtle dives. The best sea turtle zone runs
from Hekili Point north, past Lahaina, to Honolua Bay, Howeth says. From
turtles to temps, the delights of Maui diving are many. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

small reef fish. However, the drift dives on the outside of Molokini's

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">A simple story: Microsoft
mogul Bill Gates got married here a few years ago. He rented most of the
island's lodging for about a week. Lanai never has been the same. </P>


But the
hotels &amp; reefs here were resplendent &amp; world class long before
Bill &amp; Melinda tied the big knot. We felt powerfully compelled to check
Lanai out; &amp; we we did so with gusto -- topside, underwater, on the
back-country trails, along the wilderness beaches &amp; way out to the
off-road sanctuaries frequented only by Lanai locals.<BR>
<BR>
We timed our visit to Lanai shortly after the Gates Bash &amp; we were
astonished by the sheer opulence of the hotels, the extravagant lushness
of the two world-class golf courses, the landscaping &amp; architecture,
&amp; rooms that seem almost too beautiful to sleep in. Lanai is America's
ONLY answer to the world's ultimate island retreats, such as Vatulele Island
&amp; the Forbes Island (Laucala) in Fiji, or Lizard Island in Australia.
It's hard to believe this beautiful Pacific haven was once a gritty old
pineapple farm. But topside aside, the vibrant sea floor off Lanai, one
of the two or three best scuba diving destinations in all of Hawaii, is
another inspiring reason to visit, to snorkel &amp; to dive.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">&quot;There are awesome
geological formations that you won't find anywhere else in the world,&quot;
Howeth says of Lanai's underwater lava sanctuaries. My dives at the Cathedrals,
Sergeant Major &amp; Sergeant Minor are among the most memorable day trips
I've relished in Hawaii since 1990. Lanai is close to the best coral &amp;
cavern setting of any reasonably accessible dive destination in the state.
On one free dive last year, I saw a magnificent eagle ray near the 30-foot
bottom swim to within three feet of my mask. Then he just parked for a
moment &amp; my pulse went ballistic. He must have seen eyes as wide as
tank boots. That old ray's ludicrous yet endearing piglet snout was enough
to crack up even a British sentry. I will forever associate Lanai with
that otherworldly instant in time. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">&quot;I've seen up to seven
eagle rays at a time at Monolith (another dynamite South Shore site),&quot;
says Howeth of his best Lanai diving adventures. &quot;Once it looked like
a fighter squadron of airplanes. They were actually in a V formation!&quot;</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Howeth observes that Lanai's
drawing card is dual: &quot;It's accessible AND spectacular. Usually you
get only one or the other in Hawaii. Plus you don't need long surface swims.
One time you might find a triton's trumpet, the next time a whale shark.
We average one whale shark a year. It's like - what's that huge wreck floating
over there. Hey, it's a whale shark! On Lanai, you get these magical days
all the time.&quot; Even on snorkeling trips, the locals agree.</FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Hawaii is
an island state that, once it grips your fancy, is not likely to let loose
any time soon. Yes Virginia, the coral bommies can be far apart in Hawaii,
&amp; their life forms are seldom riotous; but it's a bona fide blast hovering
over them, maintaining your BC trim in the surge, spying on dozens of tiny
fun things happening at once -- shrimp, nudibranchs, neon-vivid wrasses,
jittery triggerfish -- all dancing around a coralhead the size of a Volkswagen
Beetle. That is the underwater Hawaii we love.  And that's why Hawaii dive vacations are such 
a splendid value, year after year.  Hawaii dive packages are cheap, fun &amp; safe. Pure &amp; simple. </FONT></FONT></B><BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT></B>

<P>All dive package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Lodging, side tour &amp; diving prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard per FAA rules. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our tropical vacation experts normally secure excellent wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated all U.S.-based airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals.  Early is good when seeking the best air ticket rates.</P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above scuba diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At many dive resorts, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International air tickets &amp; commuter "island-hopper" seats are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $45 per person for the land portion + $25 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts.</P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for all of our dive resorts, side tours &amp; air ticket specials is by e-check, ACH or conventional wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations via direct wire transfer only. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest &amp; our prices the lowest in this industry, &amp; thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard.</P>

<P>So if you want to dig further into these topics: Hawaii diving, Hawaii dive vacation, Lahaina Divers, Hawaii dive vacations, Hawaii dive resorts, Maui, Hawaii snorkeling, Maui diving, Kauai, Big Island, Kona, Kona Coast, Kona diving, Niihau, Lahaina, Hawaiian vacation, Molokini Crater, Oahu, Hawaii vacations -- please feel free to call us any time!  We would love to help you any way we can.</P>
