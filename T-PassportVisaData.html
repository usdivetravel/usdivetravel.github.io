<BR>&nbsp;
<P>This list is for U.S. citizens traveling on tourism or business & 
does not apply to persons planning to
<BR>emigrate to foreign countries.&nbsp; Persons traveling on official
business for the U.S. Government should obtain
<BR>visa information from the agency sponsoring their travel.&nbsp; For
purposes of this publication, a visa is an
<BR>endorsement or stamp placed by officials of a foreign country on a
U.S. passport that allows the bearer to
<BR>visit that foreign country.&nbsp; Note: Wherever you see the words
"photo(s) required" in this publication, it
<BR>generally means that you will need to submit passport-size (2"x2")
photos.
<BR>&nbsp;

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">
<P><B>IMPORTANT CAVEAT to ALL TRAVEL CLIENTS:</B>

<BR><B>THIS INFORMATION IS SUBJECT to CHANGES.</B>
<BR><B>BE SURE to CHECK ENTRY REQUIREMENTS with</B>
<BR><B>CONSULAR OFFICIALS of all COUNTRIES to be VISITED</B>
<BR><B>WELL in ADVANCE of YOUR INTENDED DEPARTURE DATE –</B>
<BR><B>JUST to MAKE SURE ALL DETAILS are FULLY in ORDER.</B>

<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The BASICS on PASSPORTS:</FONT></B>
<BR>U.S. citizens who travel to a country where a valid passport is not
required will need documentary evidence of their U.S. citizenship and identity. Proof
of U.S. citizenship includes an expired U.S. passport, a certified (original)
birth certificate, Certificate of Naturalization, Certificate of Citizenship,
or Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States. To prove identity,
a valid driver's license or
government identification card are acceptable provided they identify
you by physical description or
photograph. However, for travel overseas and to facilitate reentry
into the U.S., a valid U.S. passport is the
best documentation available and unquestionably proves your U.S. citizenship.
<P>Before you send your passport through the mail to apply for a visa,
sign it and write your current address and daytime telephone number in the space 
provided. This will
help the U.S. Postal Service return it to you should it become separated from the envelope during
processing.
Some countries require that your U.S. passport be valid at least six
months or longer beyond the dates of
your trip. If your passport expires before the required validity, you
will have to apply for a new one. Please
check with the embassy or nearest consulate of the country you plan
to visit for their requirements.
Some Middle Eastern or African countries will not issue visas or allow
entry if your passport indicates travel to Israel. Consult the National
Passport Information Center (1-900-225-5674) for guidance if this applies
to you.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>VISAS SHOULD BE OBTAINED BEFORE PROCEEDING ABROAD.</FONT></B>
<BR>Allow sufficient time for processing your visa application, especially
if you are applying by mail. Most foreign consular representatives are
located in principal cities, and in many instances, a traveler may be required
to obtain visas from the consular office in the area of his/her residence.
The addresses of foreign consular offices in the United States may be obtained
by consulting the Congressional Directory in the library.&nbsp; IT IS THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF the TRAVELER TO OBTAIN VISAS, WHERE REQUIRED, FROM the 
APPROPRIATE EMBASSY OR NEAREST CONSULATE OF THE COUNTRY YOU ARE PLANNING
TO VISIT.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>REQUIRED IMMUNIZATIONS:</FONT></B>
<BR>Under the International Health Regulations adopted by the World Health
Organization, a country may require International Certificates of Vaccination
against yellow fever. A cholera immunization may be required if you are
traveling from an infected area. Check with health care providers or your
records to ensure other immunizations (e.g. tetanus and polio) are up-to-date.
Prophylactic medication for malaria and certain other preventive measures
are advisable for travel to some countries. No immunizations are required
to return to the USA. Detailed health information is included
in Health Information for International Travel , available from the U.S.
Government Printing Office for a nominal fee or may be obtained from your local health
department or physician or by contacting the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, toll-free at 1-888/232-3228, toll-free autofax 1-888/232-3299
or Internet: http://www.cdc.gov.
<P>An increasing number of countries have established regulations regarding
AIDS testing, particularly for
long-term visitors. Although many are listed here, check with the embassy
or consulate of the country you
plan to visit to verify if this is a requirement for entry.
<P>All international flights are subject to U.S. Immigration and U.S. Customs
fees paid in advance as part of your ticket. In addition, many countries
have departure fees that are often collected at the time of ticket
purchase, or before getting your exit visa stamped.
