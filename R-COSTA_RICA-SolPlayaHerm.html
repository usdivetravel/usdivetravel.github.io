<P>Your Bill Beard's Diving Safaris vacation package includes:

7 nights accommodation (double-occupancy) in an ocean-view room in Costa

Rica's premier Pacific Coast diving resort + 6 days

of guided 2-tank boat diving with the most experienced dive operation in

Costa Rica + free snacks &amp; beverages on the dive boat + hotel taxes

paid. Round-trip transfers overland from San Jose to the Villa Sol Hotel

via air-conditioned van are extra. Also extra are tips, drinks & 

meals each day of this Costa Rica dive resort package.</FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Call us about our discount wholesale airfares from most

major U.S. cities, on Continental Airlines, to San Jose, Costa Rica. We

often have the lowest wholesale airfares in the country to Costa Rica --

through our partner's special sweetheart contract. These tickets are in

steep demand &amp; often sell out early.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>A new &amp; well-appointed vacation property, Villa Sol Hotel is situated just above one of western Costa Rica's most renowned

white-sand beaches, appropriately named Playa Hermosa, or The Beautiful

Beach. Views from the rooms &amp; the beach are sweeping &amp; wonderful.

The resort features 100 total rooms, 54 of which are deluxe. The deluxe

rooms at Villa Sol Hotel offer 2 double beds, private bath, central

A/C, walk-in closet, private terrace or balcony &amp; daily maid service,

with the kind of sweet-spirited service that only the ultra-gracious &quot;Tico&quot;

people of Costa Rica can provide.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>There are two swimming pools at Villa Sol, plus

a tennis court, volleyball nets, jet skiing &amp; kayaks available, as

well as a mini-market, a car rental office &amp; a passenger tram that

carts guests from the beach to the hotel lobby. Villa Sol also

features several in-house restaurants, bars &amp; nightclubs, including

a nifty poolside bar, where your favorite libations can be served as you

float your stress away.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Since we all know that Costa Rica diving holidays need to encompass 

far more than simply scuba sorties -- because eco-tours abound in this verdant land -- 

Villa Sol &amp; Bill Beard's Diving Safaris are

within an easy day's drive of five national parks, wildlife sanctuaries

&amp; biological preserves -- the glory of inland Costa Rica. There's a

vast number of visually exciting hikes, graded from gentle to strenuous, whatever you want, if

you're willing to hoof it for verdant views. Costa Rica's eco-adventures

are one of its top international claims to fame. The cloud forests in and

near the Guanacaste Mountains are world-renowned. Once Bill Beard's Diving

Safaris brings you back from their magical Costa Rica scuba diving world, your appetite

for eco-tours may be pretty keen; if so read further on. We have eco-energy to

the max down in Costa Rica!</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At Bill Beard's Diving Safaris & also

the Villa Sol Hotel, electricity is the same as in the U.S., so there are no

worries for divers who bring small appliances, nor for underwater video

buffs who need to recharge their battery packs. This beautiful property

is located only a few blocks from Bill Beard's Diving Safaris' main office,

&amp; a short walk from the center of the village. This is THE nerve center

for serious Costa Rica diving. Nadine & Bill Beard did a commendable 

job shaping &amp; honing their keen little corner of Costa Rica.</FONT></P>


<BR><hr><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Nadine & Bill Beard ran their Diving Safaris

business on Costa Rica's Pacific Coast for more than 30 years, then sold it to a personable young couple from 
the States named Earl & Bobbi Jo. These new owners are

widely regarded as the savviest &amp; most reliable dive operators on

the Northwest Coast of Costa Rica. This couple is basically one of the

salient forces for safe, organized scuba diving in a Costa Rica that can be a bit benignly "manana" oriented. You'll enjoy

the friendly expertise &amp; relaxed competence their crew brings to the

job. It's a couple blocks walk or tram ride down to your beach in front

of Villa Sol Hotel, so the Bill Beard divemasters will keep your dive gear

for you during your stay. They'll rinse &amp; store it &amp; have it ready

for you the next morning, so you don't have to lug it back &amp; forth

at all. Bill Beard's Diving Safaris will pick you up by boat at the beach,

or by van at your hotel entrance, whatever you prefer.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>One of several facts that make Costa Rica diving quite

pleasant most of the year is the mild climate in the Golfo de Papagayo

region of Guanacaste state. Temperatures rarely go higher than 90 degrees

F in the summer, or slide below 75 degrees in the winter, with water temps

staying pretty stable between winter's 78 &amp; summer's 82 degrees. Visibility

averages about 40-50 feet from December through April. Then May through

November the visibility -- especially in deep summer -- can reach 80 feet.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This is not a prime coral environment on the Northwest

Coast of Costa Rica. This is not Fiji by any means, we must advise. What

scuba divers come to see are the big critters: groupers, mantas, bull sharks,

vast schools of gleaming jacks &amp; rays, many of which converge on Murcielago

Island, &amp; around the sea pinnacles off El Ocotal. It's not uncommon on a typical Costa Rica diving trip 

to see a flying phalanx of eagle rays come soaring overhead, blocking the

sun for a few seconds while your heart is pounding like a piston &amp;

you rush to grab your camera. Some of the best big-fish action in Central

America is yours for the sheer enjoyment of it all, right here on the &quot;Parrot

Gulf.&quot; Pacific coastal Costa Rica is Big Critter Central in this hemisphere.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Nearly any month of the year on a Costa Rica diving tour you stand

a decent chance of sighting the mammoth, adrenaline-coaxing, yet supremely

gentle whale shark. The best time to increase your odds of sighting big

schools of flapping manta rays at the Catalina Islands, 14 miles south

of the Villa Sol Hotel, are December through May, where Bill Beard's

diving crew has chanced upon as many as 50 of these wonderful creatures

on one air tank! Some of these graceful manta rays flex wing spans from

12 to 20 feet across! Other classic dive sites that Bill Beard &amp; the

lads have developed include Punta Gorda, Escorpiones &amp; Los Meros, where

underwater camera buffs will have the chance to nab shots of the elusive

harlequin shrimp, rare nudibranchs &amp; more than 12 species of eels,

all framed against a backdrop of delicate cream-white hydroids that seem

transplanted from another distant planet of exceptional tranquility.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For couples who bring small children &amp; need a sanity-enhancement

break to accommodate their half-day dive trip, baby-sitting services are

easy &amp; affordable to contract at Villa Sol Hotel. (Don't worry,

we love kids. Our three-family partnership has six chiquitos already!)

For those who prefer a one- or two-bedroom condo instead of a hotel room,

we can also secure these for you at extra cost.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Costa Rica dive vacations are popular with divers who want to blend mountain

&amp; rain forest eco-tours along with a relaxing coastal dive vacation.

Costa Ricans are known for their gracious humor &amp; outgoing displays

of hospitality. Side tours &amp; meals throughout rural Costa Rica are

very economical if you want to ramble &amp; roam a bit around the jungle

countryside after your dive tour.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Costa Rica vacations are also renowned for the otherworldly peace,

&amp; the exotic birds &amp; mammals of its misty cloud forests. Bring

a big rain hat for the Costa Rica highlands -- that's a given !. Air tickets

are extremely reasonable to Costa Rica &amp; land costs for do-it-yourself

eco-tour extensions are quite low as well.  The sky & the sea are the limit down here. <I>Que vengan Uds para gozar

de la hermosura y la tranquilidad. Costa Rica realmente brilla.</I></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Just to give you good folks a proper perspective of the Costa Rica scuba diving scene, here

is a little back story we feel is important to retell every year, since these people are so dear to us. 

On August 15, 2010, Bill &amp; Nadine Beard, who pioneered

safe &amp; accessible scuba diving in the Golfo de Papagayo region of Costa

Rica�s Pacific Coast, celebrated 40 years of scuba diving in Costa

Rica. Our admiration &amp; respect goes out to this wonderful

couple, who have spent most of their adult lives diligently serving dive

travelers throughout our hemisphere. Many are the  divers who made their

way to Costa Rica, then returned home with colorful stories of the Bill Beard

family�s scuba diving prowess, their dive site explorations &amp; their

warm hospitality. <I>Bill y Nadine, les saludamos ! Felicitaciones por

un trabajo impresionante que han estado haciendo por mas que cuarto siglo.

Uds son buena gente, che!</I></FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Bill &amp; Nadine Beard sent U.S. Dive Travel

a detailed letter highlighting some salient aspects of their Sol Playa

Hermosa dive vacation program. We have reprinted excerpts of that letter

here below, some of which were edited for continuity:</FONT></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>Dear Diving Friends:</FONT></FONT></B></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>We are located on Playa Hermosa

Beach in the Hotel Villa Sol, where we have daily 2-tank dive trips

which leave at both 8:30 a.m. &amp; 1:00 p.m. Our night dives meet at 5:45

p.m., because the sun sets early in our area. Along with our more than

25 local dive sites within 30 minutes from our shop, we offer longer range

dive trips to the Catalina Islands & Bat Island groups. (Not to be missed !)</FONT></FONT></B></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>The best months for scuba diving in the

Catalina Islands are December through May, when we have seen up to 50 manta

rays -- with wingspans of 14 to 20 feet -- on a single dive. We dive the

Bat Islands all year round, weather permitting; however, March through

November are the optimum months for this long-range Bat Islands trip. Here we see the

impressive 8-to-15-foot bull sharks, schools of cow-nosed rays, eagle rays

and horse-eye jacks, spade fish, pompano, snapper & wahoo. (Yahoo!)</FONT></FONT></B></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>Our local dives offer many whitetip

reef sharks, plus vast schools of grunts & yellowtails, spotted eagle

rays, turtles, gigantic stingrays, angel fish, octopi, seahorses, starfish,

frog fish & many, many species of eels. We have been lucky enough to

see whale sharks up to 35 feet long on numerous occasions as well as spinner

dolphins, humpback whales, pilot whales, Orcas & false killer whales.

Also, we have seen schools of hundreds of mobula rays &amp; thousands of

cow-nose rays in one mega-school.</FONT></FONT></B></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>Water temperatures from mid-April

to mid-January are generally from 75-82 degrees Fahrenheit at depth. Then

from mid-January to mid-April, water temperatures vary from day to day,

with thermoclines sometimes causing temps to dip to 70 degrees F at depth.

The bottom line on warmth is this: you may want to bring a 3 mm wetsuit

or more during this period. The outside temperature is 85 to 90 degrees

nearly all year long.</FONT></FONT></B></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>The rainy season normally goes

from May to November, with these months providing some of our best diving.

This may seem contradictory, but because we are located in a protected

gulf & have no rivers draining into our waters, the visibility is not

adversely affected by the rain. In fact, it is often enhanced as the rain

pushes down some of the silt &amp; rich nutrients that are abundant in

Costa Rica. Average visibility ranges from 30 to 40 feet. On some special

occasions our &quot;viz&quot; reaches as far as 80 feet. On many days we

like to dive volcanic rock formations &amp; rock pinnacles. There is very

little hard coral, but we do have some black coral, soft corals &amp; the

cup coral -- which is a spectacular sight to see on night dives.</FONT></FONT></B></P>



<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+0>Safety &amp; customer enjoyment

have been our goals for the many years we have been providing service to

divers in Costa Rica. That holds especially for the 23 of our 27 Costa

Rican years that we have been located here in the Gulf of Papagayo. During

all these years we have had no serious injuries or accidents. We hope that

you will come & give our full-service staff a chance to dive with you

soon. We carry, set-up, wash & store all equipment so that you can enjoy

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>WHY the DIVING SAFARIS LOCATION

is the BEST </FONT></FONT></B><BR>



<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>on COSTA RICA�s BEAUTIFUL PACIFIC

COAST:</FONT></FONT></B>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>1. Playa Hermosa is reached by a good reliable stretch

of paved road. Other resorts are located on primitive dirt roads that get

super-muddy during seasons of heavy rainfall.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>2. Bill Beard�s Diving Safaris has special trams that

take dive clients up & down the hill to the beach. Their competition

does not have any such service for client convenience. Imagine � no more

annoying schlepping of your wet gear bags up &amp; down the steep inclines

from your hotel to the vessel dock. Talk about easy &amp; relaxing dive

days ! This is pleasure diving to the Nth degree.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>3. There are several other nice restaurants & shops

on to check out in the Playa Hermosa area, while the competitors� areas

have zilch to offer in this regard.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>4. There are two mini-marts in Playa Hermosa, none in

the other surrounding beach areas.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>5. There are plenty of fun &amp; affordable night-time

activities in Playa Hermosa, such as a disco, bars, cafes, you name it.

The other beach resort areas are very remote & isolated; so you�re stuck

there at the mercy of their ho-hum on-site amenities.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>6. Playa Hermosa has a beautiful big beach with clean

sand &amp; a nice feel to the area. In stark contrast, many of the other

beach communities have much less to offer in the way of broad clean sandy

beaches. Their oceanside sands are either dark &amp; murky looking, or

the beaches are tiny &amp; uncomfortable in their ambiance.</FONT></P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+0>7. Villa Sol Hotel has efficient, comfortable,

modern central air conditioning. The competition simply does not. Sol Playa

Hermosa Hotel is head &amp; shoulders above the competition. Bill Beard�s

Diving Safaris is all pro. Accept no imitators.</FONT></P>

(All tours here below are customized, &amp; dependent on guide availability.)</B><BR>
</B><P>(Text blocks re' Costa Rica eco-tours appear courtesy of Bill Beard's Diving Safaris.)</P>

<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>RINCON de la VIEJA ECO-TOUR:<BR>
</B></FONT>The huge &amp; imposing profile of the Rincon de la Vieja volcano completely defines the skyline of Costa Rica's famous Guanacaste Province. This is the prime region of Costa Rica's famous cloud forests. Translated from Spanish, this noble mountain's name means "The Old Lady's Corner." This is a safely dormant volcano, but its flanks are far from sleepy &amp; frail. Rincon de la Vieja's vast slopes are smothered in lush jungles that are rich with exotic flowers, birds, mammals &amp; geologic attractions. One of the most popular of these is called "Las Pallas" or the geothermal springs. These mysterious pools of boiling mud, &amp; the nearby mini-geyser &amp; hot springs, are evidence of vast volcanic forces still seething just below the earth's surface. Some travelers like to call this fascinating sector the "Yellowstone National Park of Costa Rica." There is a fertile tropical forest flanking much of the volcano, which is host to countless interesting species of rare wildlife, that have lured camera buffs &amp; eco-travelers from around the world for many years. This is one nerve center for serious eco-tourism in our hemisphere.</P>
<B><P>Two options for the Rincon de la Vieja Eco-Tour: </P>
<OL>

</B><LI>A 2-hour hike through the forest, past the steaming volcano calderas, the bubbling mudpots &amp; the geysers, &amp; a fun jaunt down to a couple wild riverbanks.</LI>
<LI>Visiting these same areas on horseback (for a modestly higher fee per person).</LI></OL>

<B><P>The Rincon de la Vieja Eco-Tours include:  </B>Box lunch + drinks + local fruits for refreshment + national park entry fees + full services of a trained biologist / wildlife guide + all transportation during the day.</P>


<BR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>ARENAL VOLCANO ECO-TOUR:<BR>
</B></FONT>The trailhead for this fascinating side tour is located about 3 hours out of Guanacaste town. The famous Arenal Volcano is a cone-shaped mountain that juts impressively from the surrounding plains of Central Costa Rica. Normally Arenal is the most active volcano in Costa Rica, sometimes gushing huge clouds of smoke &amp; ash into the air at unpredictable moments. Some nights when the visibility is clear, eco-travelers have been delighted to observe this historic volcano spewing volumes of bright reddish &amp; orange lava, along with rumbling rocks, all of this erupting into the dark sky &amp; then flowing down the volcano's flanks into the dark jungles below. Locals know that even when the weather is a little overcast, Arenal Volcano seldom disappoints the eco-tourists watching safely from a distance. They still can see lava flows &amp; fiery eruptions like a foggy glow through the tropical haze. They can hear the rumble of the exploding rock flows. After a long &amp; invigorating day of hiking through the Arenal Volcano rainforests, there is a perfect little hotspring called Tabacon, where you can relax, soak your weary feet &amp; get refreshed again for the trek back to your vehicle.</P>
<B><P>The Arenal Volcano Eco-Tour includes:</P>
</B><P>Box lunch + drinks + dinner + all transportation + naturalist guide + park fees.</P>
<B><P>The 2-day Arenal Volcano Eco-Tour includes:</P>
</B><P>One night's lodging + all meals at the lovely Tabacon Resort + naturalist guide + all tour transportation + park entry fees. The itinerary for the 2-day tour is as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI>8 a.m. pickup time at your hotel in Guanacaste. (You arrive here the night before to prepare for the trek. An additional night's lodging, very affordable, will be needed.) </LI>
<LI>Lunch at Restaurante y Pizzeria Tramonti. </LI>
<LI>Hike to the magnificent Arenal Waterfall. </LI>
<LI>Additional hike through surrounding rainforest, to spot tropical species. </LI>
<LI>Visit to Tabacon Hot Springs. Supper here at the Hot Springs. </LI>
<LI>Lodging at the Arenal Observatory, 1.6 miles South of the fiery volcano. This lodge is the only hotel allowed within the boundaries of the Arenal Volcano National Park. The views from this hotel are spectacular, &amp; the volcano just looms above it. </LI>
<LI>Breakfast in the morning, then off you go back to San Jose, or to another one of our exciting Costa Rica eco-tours. The world is your oyster, of course !</LI></UL>

<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>HACIENDA LOS INOCENTES ECO-TOUR:<BR>
</B></FONT>You will get a chance to imagine yourself slipping backwards into time, back to the fateful year of 1856, when a major moment occurred in Costa Rican history, here at the old ranch house called Hacienda Los Inocentes, or Estate of the Innocents. There was a bitter battle fought here, in which scores of innocent men were slain by guns &amp; cannons; &amp; the story your guide will tell you may move you to tears, to think of how people actually struggled for survival, lived &amp; died in those wild frontier days. Here you will see many of the region's eponymous Guanacaste trees, which are thick, bulky tropical trees adorned with heavy skin &amp; thorn-studded trunks. Located just north of Liberia (where some clients may wish to fly into, since the municipal airport recently has been re-opened), this region of the Guanacaste Province is known for excellent vistas of the Orosi Volcano. The region also is known for relaxing nature hikes with many wild animal encounters &amp; rare bird sightings, &amp; for watching latter-day cowboys actually doing the same job their ancestors did 150 years ago on these lush volcanic slopes. Near the end of a full day of trekking, snapping great jungle photos &amp; relishing the gentle ways of the rural people, you will head down to the scenic overlooks of La Cruz village, where you'll be treated to a sweeping vista of Salinas Bay &amp; Bolanos Island. They say the sunsets here are something else. You'll almost wish you could stop &amp; paint them on a canvas, since mere film hardly can capture the grandeur of a fire-washed evening sky like this.</P>
<B><P>Hacienda Los Inocentes Eco-Tour includes:</P>
</B><P>Lunch + drinks + all transportation + horseback riding + naturalist guide + park fees.</P>



<BR>


<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>TEMPISQUE RIVER &amp; PALO VERDE ECO-TOUR.<BR>
</B></FONT>This eco-tour will alternately soothe &amp; rock your sensibilities as you witness, as close as safe can be, powerful jungle crocodiles idling away in the sunshine, out of reach but tensed in predatory readiness, while chattery wired monkeys flit through the jungle canopy overhead, as your vessel glides serenely down the Tempisque River -- through the famous Palo Verde Wildlife Refuge -- one of Costa Rica's best &amp; brightest eco-tourism attractions. Up until the late 1800s, this Tempisque River offered the only viable transportation route between the cloud forests &amp; mountains of the Guanacaste Province &amp; the rest of Costa Rica. The river was, &amp; is, a jungle lifeline that snakes through some of the lushest &amp; most animal-rich terrain on Planet Earth. Your 20-kilometer cruise will take you through the very heart of the Palo Verde Wildlife Refuge; &amp; your guide will give you plenty of opportunities to stop, stretch, take photos &amp; poke around the bush country to see the many rare species of mammals &amp; migratory birds that fill the jungles with their weird little sounds. This tour normally offers eco-travelers the very best chance to see exotic Costa Rican mammals &amp; birds; &amp; is really a must-see for eco-tourists who may make this their one &amp; only Costa Rica adventure. We recommend this tour highly.</P>
<B><P>Palo Verde &amp; Tempisque River Eco-Tour includes:</P>
</B><P>Lunch + drinks + tangy local fruits + services of an expert ornithologist (bird biologist) + vessel tour &amp; guide + all ground transfers to &amp; from vessel + park entry fees.</P>

</B></FONT>Costa Rica Paddle Sports is a whitewater rafting &amp; kayaking company in Costa Rica, owned by Costa Ricans &amp; operated by English speaking Costa Ricans. This is a great combination since the President is Rodolfo Quiros, the friendliest, most experienced operator &amp; guide you can find on the rivers of this jungle-rich country.</P>
<P>Rodolfo's second love is scuba diving & when he is not on the river you can probably find him scuba diving with Bill Beard's Diving Safaris or out at the Cocos Islands with the Undersea Hunter.  Rodolfo operates on three different rivers for our adventures. The Sarapiqui River which is a class II-III, Penas Blancas River also a class II-III &amp; the Pacuare which is a class III-IV. This nation's climate &amp; the rugged terrain of the landscape, offer an unique opportunity to enjoy a variety of swift rivers, dependable stream flows &amp; warm waters on a year-round basis.</P>
<P>The white waters of Costa Rica have proved to be some of the best for river rafting in the world. It is not only the class levels they offer &amp; the challenge they provide, but the stunning natural beauty that accompanies you downriver that makes white water rafting in Costa Rica a unique experience. Whether you are a first timer &amp; just want to discover what it feels like to run down a river surrounded only by rain forest &amp; a few native inhabitants or an old pro craving for new challenges, experiencing the white waters of Costa Rica will prove to be the experience you were looking for.</P>

<FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></B></FONT>

<P>All Costa Rica diving package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving travel market. Costa Rica dive tour prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; & that has been our pledge for one decade now.  Our tropical vacation experts normally secure wholesale discount air tickets for our clients who book early enough to secure limited seats in the best price categories.  Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals. </P>

<P>Unless specifically noted, these above Costa Rica scuba diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At many Costa Rica diving resorts, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International &amp; commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $35 per person for the land portion + $30 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at many of our dive resorts. Solo clients on our Costa Rica diving vacations may pay a single supplement during peak seasons to secure a private room -- normally 35% to 50% more than double-occupancy clients.</P>

<P>The preferred payment mode for all dive resorts & Costa Rica eco-tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their dive vacations or Costa Rica eco-tours via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any reservation. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level -- for both scuba vacations & Costa Rica eco-tours -- is the highest & our prices the lowest in this industry, & thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings, USDT always accepts Visa & Mastercard.</P>

<P>Remember, all Costa Rica diving tour clients to all foreign destinations will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $30 - $40 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; & away you go. Best of luck with your plans for Costa Rica eco-tours & Costa Rica dive travel. We hope your scuba diving vacation is a safe & satisfying adventure. Blessings & best wishes with ALL your Costa Rica dive vacations.  And let's not forget the good ol' refrain -- Costa Rica eco-tours, Costa Rica eco-tours, Costa Rica eco-tours, Costa Rica eco-tours, Costa Rica eco-tours -- nothing but the finest green trekking in our hemisphere.  Say it to Gaia, "Who loves you, baby?!"</P>
