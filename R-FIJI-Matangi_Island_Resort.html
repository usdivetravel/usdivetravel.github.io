<P>Your Matangi Island dive package includes: Lodging in a private ocean-front bure with a magnificent South Pacific view, right near the lagoon + 3 delicious sit-down meals each day + Fijian

sales tax paid + unlimited free tank refills for shore diving in the lagoon

+ round-trip transfers from Taveuni docks by speedboat

to Matangi Island (pronounced Ma-TAHNG-ee). This island used to be called Matagi for many years, 
until the phonetic equivalent changed recently for the convenience of dive tours.  For those folks toting kids,

baby-sitting is available at nominal fees from local village women who

work with the resort. The village women of Matangi Island are very reliable &amp; gentle with children

-- the best nannies this side of the big blue Pacific.</P>



<P>So, how do our dive tours get you to Matangi Island, one of the most beautiful &amp;

exclusive resort getaways in the Fiji Islands, or even the greater South Pacific? First, you fly from the West Coast to Nadi (pronounced

&quot;NAHN-dee&quot;) on Fiji's main island, Viti Levu, which is about

3,174 air miles southwest of Honolulu. Then you grab a puddle-jumper flight

from Nadi up to Taveuni Island, which sits about 90 miles northeast of

Viti Levu, right on the Strait of Somosomo.</P>



<P>Then the resort sends a vessel to meet you at a North Taveuni dock,

just a quick mini-van ride away from the Taveuni airport. You travel about

6 miles offshore, to the northeast; &amp; 40 minutes later you're on Matagi.

This is a lush &amp; scenic half-moon-shaped atoll, perched stop an extinct

volcanic crater, about 240 acres, with a dramatic 440-foot-high promontory

in the middle. Matangi Island has been owned by the Douglas family for many years;

&amp; they run the island with keen attention to detail, &amp; care for

the environment.  South Pacific dive trips are their life force & they are artists here.</P>

<P>The Matangi Island treehouse, one of the South Pacific's most unique lodging units,

is really for any couples, not just newlyweds, who want to rekindle their

romance in a wonderfully peaceful setting, where the staff pampers you

like relatives at a reunion. Nestled 30 feet above ground in a South Pacific

almond tree, this secluded aerie features a commanding view of the Tasman

Straits, across gentle seas to Taveuni, where you can take day trips any

time you wish. (See the first Fiji item in the resort directory for details

on the many exciting side tours on Taveuni Island). With the ocean softly

lapping below you, &amp; tropical birds singing in the branches all around

you, you're guaranteed to see your stress dissolve, then evanesce, like

shave ice on a summer sidewalk.</P>



<P>At Matangi Island Resort,  each of the 10 beautifully decorated bures (traditional South Pacific thatch-roofed

cabins) features a queen-sized bed &amp; a lounge area with a day bed,

plus full bathroom with shower &amp; vanity. There's a fully-stocked mini-bar

&amp; a coffee maker with Fijian-grown beans to savor, a ceiling fan &amp;

a cozy little net draped over the bed in a romantic canopy. The meals on Matangi Island are

marvelous &amp; this dive resort has an ample wine list to satisfy even picky

palates.  After all, Fiji diving trips are more than clunky tanks & regulators.</P>



<P>Kids love Matangi Island Resort because there are acres of trees &amp; hills to explore

&amp; the island is safe &amp; secure for them -- no dangerous land critters,

no sinkholes, no bad tropical bugs (neither viral nor the many-legged kind).

There's zero malaria in Northeastern Fiji; another plus. With a few tips on

steering clear of urchins &amp; cone shells -- the obvious ocean bugaboos

-- kids can snorkel safely in the lagoon when weather permits; &amp; parents

needn't worry a bit. In fact, the Matangi Island Resort region of Fiji may be one of the

South Pacific's most child-friendly ocean sectors, with its gentle currents,

warm clear water &amp; plenty of healthful sunshine.</P>

<P>You'll be overwhelmed at first by the depth of service &amp; kindness

that Fijians show to all newcomers to Matangi Island Resort. 

These Melanesian South Pacific natives

are among the world's most gracious hosts; it's part of their family-centered

culture, bred into their temperaments from birth. They won't even take

tips from you, since service is an honorable art to them, which gives them

great pleasure &amp; self-esteem. You will be spoiled out of your socks

by the innocent culture of Fiji, & by this island, a very unique marine sanctuary.</P>



<P>Now for a bright spot in Fiji diving. There's a lot of ballyhoo in some pretty 

overblown diving magazines about Fiji diving being centered on Viti Levu, the big island.

Balderdash.   Baloney.  Bull-roar.  Barnum & Bailey.  Stay as far away from the touristy 

kitsch of that island as you can.  Real Fiji diving is around the Taveuni-Matangi sector.  

The diving 

& snorkeling in Northeastern Fiji is widely acknowledged to be the best in the 

Fiji Islands, &amp; one of the world's prime sectors for wildly colorful soft corals

&amp; hordes of reef fish. Matangi Island's own lagoon &amp; environs are rich

in corals &amp; fish life, &amp; the reefs are more protected, with less

current than the Somosomo Straits usually offer. Your Matangi Island Resort dive guides know

this sector like their own back yard, &amp; they'll show you some underwater

havens that few people ever are blessed to visit. Fiji diving at Matagi Island Resort is like

plunging into a kaleidoscope of Pacific Ocean vitality. Relaxing, easy, warm water with great viz:  that's the gist 

of Matangi Island diving & snorkeling.  And this is one of the prime nerve centers 

for excellent Fiji diving, our leaders on these South Pacific dive tours confirm.</P>



<P>With only 10 bures &amp; a maximum of 24 guests, Matangi Island Resort never

feels crowded or trampled by visitors. Among other water activities you

can pursue after your Fiji diving or Fiji snorkeling are: windsurfing, paddle-boarding,

Hobie-cat sailing, saltwater fly fishing, &amp; picnic jaunts to thundering

Bouma Falls on Taveuni. Local villagers each week perform a rousing meke

-- traditional songs &amp; folk dancing that will gladden your heart.</P>



<P>The peaceful &amp; hospitable spirit of the Fijians is a balm to tired

travelers. This pure &amp; simple escape, the green trees, the flowers

&amp; their fresh scent, the perfect underwater grottoes, will weave their

way into the fabric of your mind &amp; your heart; &amp; when you return

home, you will always have a fresher outlook on what life can really be

when the stress of the city is ignored for a brief shining moment in the old-fashioned South Pacific. Fiji

changed our lives forever. You may be blessed the same way. Forget anxiety

&amp; regrets; dive right in. Dive trips to Matangi Island create a magic that lasts a lifetime. Just close

your eyes at your desk, lean back, breathe deeply in -- &amp; yes, you're

back again. You made it. "<I>Vinaka vaka levu, Fiji Islands" </I>you will whisper.  "Thank you, big time!"<BR>

<font size=+2><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><b>MAGICAL SIDE TOURS to the NEIGHBOR ISLAND of TAVEUNI:<BR>
These DAY TRIPS are FUN, SAFE, EASY to PLAN & VIRTUALLY FREE of CHARGE<BR>
ONCE YOU'VE PAID for the FERRY & a FEW SHORT CAB JAUNTS --<BR></font></font></b>


<P> Before we dive into some fun tips for side tours while you're on Matangi Island, here is one important tip for travalers:  the Fijian people are so gracious that they will not even accept tips

from you. To tip would insult a Fijian, for whom TLC service is an art

form, a duty in which one takes the highest pride in pleasing guests, not

in how much money one takes home at the end of the day. That's the soul of the South Pacific for you.  

It's been a while

in North America since folks felt <I>that</I> way about their work, eh?  That's one of many reasons why we feel 
that Matangi Island Resort & side tours (day trips) to the sister island of Taveuni are an ideal way to spend a perfect South Pacific honeymoon.  Taveuni side trips, easily accomplished by taking the daily ferry from Matangi to the north end of Taveuni island, have a way of healing some pretty stressed-out people, we have seen over the years. </P>



<P>How could we ever list all the cool things about Taveuni without verging on hyperbole? Here's one

fun factoid: you can walk a mere hundred meters down the village lane &amp;

you reach a concrete marker that you can straddle -- where your right foot

is planted in Wednesday while your left foot actually is back in Tuesday!

No kidding. This is the 180th parallel, where the world's geographic new day really

begins! </P>



<P>A big plus for families who bring small kids is this: the local village

ladies, who are sweet as Tupelo honey, will &quot;nanny&quot; your kids

for half a day or more, for only a few dollars an hour. It would take an

encyclopedia to list everything we love about Taveuni, but we'll start

here &amp; now with the Reader's Digest version. </P>



<P>In a South Pacific vacation industry that's riddled with giddy superlatives,

where many dive resorts &amp; live-aboard diving vessels boast that they're &quot;world class;&quot;

&amp; every reef is supposedly &quot;pristine &amp; unspoiled,&quot; it's

tough to find a place that really lives up to its hype. Taveuni people

don't hype their island. This South Pacific island sells itself.  Just like a kid's smile does.  They don't need to hype 
Taveuni to get people down here.  Coming straight from the heart,

&amp; from a professional dive-travel partnership that has closely studied

more than two dozen cultures &amp; countries worldwide over the last quarter

century, we believe we have found one island sanctuary that truly stands

above any other in Polynesia. For reasons of spirit, geography &amp; economy,

that island is Taveuni; &amp; we love it like no other.</P>



<P>After traveling the oceans of the world for decades, members of the

Jacques Cousteau clan bought vacation land just across the channel from here. Taveuni Island is a place that, unless

you have a heart of granite, will leave a magical mark on you forever.  Northeastern Fiji is the unplucked 

pearl of the South Pacific.  So where IS Taveuni, you ask?</P>

<HR><br>




<P>Fiji's main island, Viti Levu, is about 3,174 air miles southwest of

Honolulu; &amp; Taveuni sits about 90 miles northeast of Viti Levu, right

on the Strait of Somosomo. Taveuni is an island abundantly blessed, first with the world-famous Rainbow Reef, 

next with mountains, river, waterfalls & glorious jungle topography.  You'll

find gracious &amp; hospitable people, wonderful weather, a scarcity of

hazards &amp; a reef environment so brilliant that it's rivaled in wild

color &amp; marine life by maybe only the Red Sea, Palau, Papua New Guinea,

the Solomon Islands &amp; Indonesia. Your Fijian hosts are incredibly easy-going,

sweet-spirited &amp; generous. </P>



<P>Not one month goes by when we don't think of Taveuni island &amp; want to return

there soon. We always try to imagine what our neighborhoods, schools, churches

&amp; workplaces in the U.S. would feel like if they followed the same

simple rules of human decency &amp; kindness that are standard everyday

reality on Taveuni island -- &amp; in most of Fiji's outer isles. Thus is born

the only major regret we've ever had about Fiji: that we can't be there nearly 

all the time, or at least live among people who treat one another with

the courtesy &amp; dignity that the Fijians simply take for granted. We

believe there's more to an earthly Paradise than mere geography. Palm trees, sugar

sand, lapping surf; sure all of those things are great to be around. But

there's more. The ethos of a culture, the sense of community, the stability

of traditions, the civility so lacking in big American cities -- these

may be the real ingredients of the Paradise we are all subliminally seeking

when we take our vacations. Tough to put such spiritual factors into language;

but you surely feel you've come home when you visit Tavueni Island.</P>



<P>Taveuni also offers some of Fiji's most colorful diving, on the globally renowned

Rainbow Reef, where abundant corals &amp; swarming Technicolor fish create

a living light show. Some dive pros clain Taveuni diving IS Fiji diving at its best.  Many of the best Taveuni Island sites 
can be accessed by your vessels on Matangi Island.

Some special dive days you'll enjoy

your dive-day lunch on a trackless half-mile strand of white sugar sand

on Fiji's second largest island, Vanua Levu, about 10 miles across the Somosomo

Strait from Taveuni. Here on this deserted beach you'll see playful sea

turtles, a great snorkeling cove &amp; a lush jungle canopy with plenty

of cool shade.   Among classic dive sites you'll visit are The Great White Wall,

Blue Ribbon Eel Reef &amp; Annie's Bommie. The Taveuni-area currents are a bit frisky

some days, but that moving water feeds the soft corals, which bloom to

awesome density &amp; size on the Rainbow Reef.  Taveuni Island diving is always athletic, but the exertion is 
hugely rewarded by ample Fiji diving treats -- outstanding "viz" & marine life that won't quit.</P>

<P>Now back to the land. Fiji is safe &amp; clean. There is absolutely

zero malaria, no dangerous land insects or critters, no political unrest

-- unlike other prime coral-reef regions in the South Pacific tropics such as

the Solomon Islands &amp; Papua New Guinea.</P>



<P>But there's something more; something exotic on Taveuni island -- the back-country

side tours. You can do most of these on your own, for the mere cost of

a cabby &amp; park entry fees.</P>



<P>For example, you can hike about 25 minutes from the lodge out to the

Waitavala Waterslide, a modestly steep stream bed that forms a natural

&quot;body bobsled&quot; chute several hundred meters long. This waterslide

careens down a hillside, &amp; you zip down its mossy stream bed, laying

on your back, feet first. You can whizz down the slide about 15 mph, no

bumps &amp; no bruises, then you spill out perfectly safe &amp; laughing

hysterically, into a cool pool at the bottom of a small cascade. It's outstanding

fun! This waterslide, &amp; much of Taveuni island, were featured in the film

&quot;Return to the Blue Lagoon.&quot; </P>



<P>Another day you can hire a cab to towering Bouma Falls, then spend half

a day hiking up to see the three tiers of this magnificent waterfall, which

are interspersed along 4 miles of challenging jungle trails. Each tier

is 50-80 feet high, with thundering volumes of water &amp; clear deep pools

below, perfect for swimming &amp; swan diving off the rocks. Oddly beautiful

purple-velvet-covered freshwater crabs glide along windfall trunks at river's

edge. Exotic birds flit through the tree canopies: red &amp; green parrots,

flaming orange doves, mischievous magpies. This place is peaceful, clean

&amp; serene -- pure joy.</P>



<P>You also might want to spend one afternoon visiting quiet little Lavena

Village, where after securing permission from the chief, you may take photos

of the spunky children &amp; their sweet games with primitive stick toys.

You'll see many traditional huts called &quot;bures,&quot; &amp; you'll

have to politely fend off a myriad invitations to dine or drink kava with

families all over the village. These folks are so kind &amp; caring they'd

adopt you in a wink if you let them. There is no equivalent in North America

to the ingenuous hospitality of the Fijian people.  They will enchant you, pure & simple.</P>



<P>Near Lavena village on Taveuni, you'll want to hike these ancient South Pacific beaches searching for perfect

specimens among thousands of rare &amp; bizarrely shaped seashells that

are tossed ashore every day by new tides. (To respect the island's ecosystem,

we recommend you don't remove any shells; just photograph them.) Days like

this produce memories of natural wonders &amp; warm native souls that travelers

will treasure for a lifetime. The Fijian people are so sweet-spirited &amp;

giving that their hospitality &amp; humor will refresh even the most stressed-out

city folks. Their laughter is musical, almost healing. You'll see.</P>



<P>On another great Taveuni island day trip, you can rent a Jeep or take a taxi to the

trailhead, then spend an entire day hiking up a long &amp; semi-strenuous

jungle trail, replete with slippery rocks, gnarled roots, &amp; knotted

vines to grab ahold of, as you climb towards the summit of Des Voeux Peak,

nearly 4,000 feet above sea level. Nestled below the pinnacle is Taveuni's

most famous geographic landmark -- Lake Tagimaucia, a deep body of pristine

water that fills an ancient volcano crater, similar to hidden mountain

lakes in Guatemala.</P>



<P>Lake Tagimaucia is filled with floating masses of lush vegetation &amp; is

home to Fiji's most prized flower, the &quot;tagimaucia.&quot; This huge tagimaucia 

blossom, which can be as big as a bowling ball, is bright red with a white

center. The Lake Tagimaucia trail is often muddy &amp; challenging, so clients are advised

to wear battered old tennies or lightweight boots. If time &amp; weather

permit, some members of the party may try for a closer approach to the

summit, for some spectacular views of Taveuni island from one of the highest

points in all of Fiji.</P>



<P>A special bonus on many Lake Tagimaucia hikes is some of the finest

bird-watching in Fiji. Two beautiful species that exist nowhere else on

Earth -- the Orange-Breasted Dove &amp; the Silktail -- flit about in the

verdant jungle that rims this awe-inspiring lake.</P>

overhanging ledge high above you. The vessel trip &amp; hike require a

long &amp; physical day, but are safe &amp; well worth the moderate exertion.</LI>

<P>Taveuni island can be summed up in one lilting phrase used by the natives --

it's written "seqa na leqa " but it's pronounced &quot;senga na lenga&quot; &amp; it means &quot;hang loose,

everything is fine.&quot; Rare is the man or woman who boards their puddle

jumper back to Viti Levu, &amp; who doesn't have at least a glimmer of

dew in their eyes when they leave Taveuni, the Flowered Island of Fiji.

God bless Taveuni island, pure &amp; simple as she is. Actually, He already has. You'll

see for yourself.</P>

<b><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR="#0000ff"><P>IMPORTANT REMINDER about PRICES &amp; TARIFFS:</P></b>
</B></FONT><P>All dive package prices listed here are subject to possible change in this steadily evolving Fiji diving & Fiji snorkeling market. Lodging & Fiji diving prices are traditionally stable, while air prices can fluctuate daily. Until air tickets are issued, all airlines reserve the right to change airfares without notice -- an industry standard. We at U.S. Dive Travel will price-protect you to the utmost of our professional ability; &amp; that has been our pledge for one decade now. We normally secure excellent discount air tickets. Remember please, the federal government has deregulated airlines, so only they control their pricing -- not any travel professionals. </P>

<P>Please feel free to call our Fiji vacation experts at   <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>&nbsp;952-953-4124&nbsp;</B></FONT>, for any questions you may have about these Fiji vacation topics -- Matangi Island, Matagi Island, Matangi Island Resort, Matagi Island Resort, Matagi, Matangi, Taveuni, Taveuni island, Fiji, Fiji Islands, Fiji diving, South Pacific vacations, South Pacific dive resorts, South Pacific diving, South Pacific snorkeling, or Fiji snorkeling  &   Fiji scuba diving</P>


<P>Unless specifically noted, these above Fiji scuba diving packages are prices for only the land-based portion of the dive resorts, in most cases reflecting double-occupancy rooms. At many dive resorts, there will be no triple-occupancy rooms offered. Some exceptions will be noted. International &amp; commuter "island-hopper" airfares are always extra above these land costs. Nominal service fees are also extra for air tickets &amp; the vessel + side tour components. The baseline tariffs for all clients start at $35 per person for the land portion + $25 pp for the air tickets. Late-booking clients may receive slightly higher tariffs on the lodging + diving at most of these dive resorts. </P>
<P>The preferred payment mode for all Fiji dive resorts & side tours is by cashier's check or wire transfer in U.S. dollars. All clients living outside the USA or Canada will need to pay for their Fiji scuba diving vacations only via direct wire transfer in U.S. dollars. No personal checks will be accepted for the land portion of any Fiji scuba diving or Fiji snorkeling reservation, please. Thank you for your gracious understanding. Our service level is the highest &amp; our prices the lowest in this industry, &amp; thus we need to preserve a reasonable margin. For published-fare air ticket bookings on your Fiji scuba diving vacation, USDT always accepts Visa &amp; Mastercard. For ultra-discount wholesale air tickets, however, USDT accepts only cashier's checks, please.</P>
<P>Remember, all Fiji diving & Fiji snorkeling clients will be asked by local officials overseas, upon departing the airport on your final day, to pay a nominal government departure tax, usually between USD $35 - $45 per client. USDT cannot collect this tax beforehand, so you simply pay it down there, in your host country. Be sure to stash away a little cash for this final moment at the airport, so you'll get your exit visa stamped quickly with no fuss; &amp; away you go. Best of luck with your dive travel plans. </P>


<P>We hope your Fiji scuba diving vacation is a safe &amp; satisfying adventure. Blessings &amp; best wishes with ALL your Fiji dive vacations.</P>
<P>Best fishes too!</P>
