<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">1. Always book your air tickets
as early as possible </FONT></B>, to enhance your chances of securing
bulk-fare or consolidator prices. These discount air tickets are in steep   
demand & normally sell out quite early. A good target for dive tour group leaders on  
dive resort & live-aboard vacations, is to nail down your deposits on air tickets no later than 220 - 180 days before
departure when your trip occurs during a holiday period or a peak demand
season. Earlier is always better with dive travel bookings, for all dive resort & live-aboard vacations. 
When you travel during low season, 90+ days advance purchase most often nets you the prime deal on air tickets. For single dive travelers, couples &amp; small groups,
it's most economical to pay in full more than 90 days before departure.
Be especially wary of peak-season space crunches, so you don't set your heart on certain
dates, then feel defeated when the air seats have vanished into, er, thin air. The busiest
air-travel peaks of the dive vacation year are listed here in descending
order of client demand:</FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Spring Break (from
about March 15 - April 25)</FONT></B> is virtually every year the most intensively
busy period of the year for any dive resort & live-aboard vacations. 
That's because thousands of families, dive clubs,
plus well-to-do couples &amp; single travelers pour southward from the
Lower 48 States to vacation -- when the kids are conveniently out of school.
They flow into the Caribbean region, the Pacific Rim, all over Mexico &amp;
Hawaii. Spring Break is like Christmas season to the Third Power. If you
can, avoid the season entirely.  However, if you need to travel then, get started VERY early -- 
that means 7 - 9 months out, especially with any quality live-aboard.
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Christmas Time (from
about Dec. 15 - Jan. 5)</FONT></B> is another peak-demand peak, particularly for the world's top 
live-aboard locales.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Thanksgiving Season
(from about Nov. 20 - 30).</FONT></FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Nov. 15 - April 20 </FONT></B>in
general is the heavy "winter" vacation season for North Americans. If you're
planning to travel during this period, it's best to book both land &amp;
air reservations quite early. This especially holds true for the world's
top live-aboards or dive resorts, some of which are likely to fill
up 8 - 10 months in advance.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</LI>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">2. Try to book land
reservations (lodging, diving, side tours) no later than this -- deposits
90 days before departure, final payment 70 days before departure</FONT></B>
-- during low seasons. Then during high seasons, get your land deposits
paid no later than 120 days out, &amp; final payments 70 days out, to ensure
the best prices &amp; lodging selection. Remember, in many cases you may
avoid additional service fees by paying your land &amp; air rez in full right
when you book. This holds for most quality dive resort & live-aboard vacations.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">3.</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Communicate
clearly with your agent.</FONT></B> Specify exactly what you expect to
spend &amp; how much travel time you need. Don't be shy about any details.
We are here to serve you. Insist that your travel agent hold
tightly to your budget guidelines.<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">
</FONT></B>No USDT staffer ever will pressure you to spend more than you
feel is right. We have a big red and yellow sign hanging in our St. Paul office that
declares: &quot;Cheap is good!&quot;  Please feel free to call us any time for help: 
<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">952-953-4124</FONT></B>.</FONT></P>

<P>Calculate what you believe is the proper dive
vacation budget for you: what's affordable here &amp; now, not what you're
wishing for. Be straight with your dive travel agent, so he or she will
work harder to match your expectations to a &quot;T.&quot; Never sidetrack
your dive vacation agent into checking packages you dream about but realistically
cannot afford. Remember we are a buyer's agent. We serve you first, not
the airlines.  So play it straight & you will always get better service & better deals.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P>There's never a reason for you, our valued dive
travel clients, to feel shy about setting your dive resort or liveaboard vacation budget &amp; sticking
to it. Blue-chip or blue-collar -- it doesn't matter much to us.  We treat everybody like family around here. 
What impresses <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S. Dive Travel </FONT></B>
is not carefree spending sprees, but dive vacation clients who are gracious, well-organized
from the start, &amp; who know exactly what they want. It's so much easier
to serve you efficiently &amp; accurately that way.  And it's more fun for all of
us.  That's really the point here; this whole process should be fun from A to Z, from the dream's inception, 
through the planning stages, to relishing the actual adventure itself. Who can put a price on fun? </FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">4. </FONT></B>If you're
spending more than $1,500 per person for the dive vacation (land &amp;
air total), <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">U.S. Dive Travel recommends that you
purchase travel insurance</FONT></B>, especially to cover loss or theft
of gear, or unavoidable trip cancellation. As a matter of policy, U.S.
Dive Travel  never will sell travel insurance for any dive resort or liveaboard vacation. 
(To see why not, click
on our &quot;Open Letter to Clients&quot; under the &quot;Facts About U.S.
Dive Travel&quot; hot-link on the Home Page.) However, we're happy to help
you research the market yourselves to find a dependable deal. Please refer
to the "How to Find the Best Travel Insurance" hot-link on
our Home Page. </FONT><BR>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">5.</FONT></B> If you
want objective, professionally <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">independent reviews</FONT></B>
of dive resorts or live-aboards -- from publications that are NOT beholden to their 
advertisers -- we recommend two periodicals above all others -- Undercurrent and Rodale's Scuba Diving magazine (RSD):</FONT><BR>
</P>

<UL>
<LI>First &amp; foremost, <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">the
Bible of the sport is Rodale's Scuba Diving magazine, or RSD for short.</FONT></B> It really <I>is</I>
the magazine that divers trust. The resort, vessel &amp; gear reviews are
crafted with integrity &amp; don't cater to big-buck advertisers. We respect
the insights, ethics &amp; professionalism of Rodale's Scuba Diving magazine, the
leader in diving journalism. By the way, nobody paid us to say this.  And we do not advertise in 
either of these periodicals.  Never have.  Rodale's Scuba Diving magazine, especially now that Skin Diver has (<I>gracias a' Dios</I>) bitten the dust, is the grandaddy of diving magazines.  BTW, our founder was a professional journalist for 15 years.  Therefore, we call 'em as we see 'em, pure & simple. So take a peek at Rodale's Scuba Diving magazine & see what you think.  RSD is well worth the time & dollars.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Undercurrent newsletter
</FONT></B>is a bold, hard-hitting consumer advocate &amp; nearly always
close to the mark with their editorial opinions. We don't always agree
with every dotted &quot;i&quot; &amp; crossed &quot;t&quot; in Undercurrent,
but all their reviews are done with strict adherence to high standards
of professional integrity. Undercurrent has helped a lot of divers steer clear of
marginal resorts &amp; vessels. Read it.  Undercurrent is as close to the Ralph Nader watchdog of 
scuba journalism as we'll find in North America, for your dive resort or liveaboard vacation.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
</LI>
</UL>


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">6.</FONT></B> When you
book wholesale land &amp; air packages, <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">positively
avoid cancellations </FONT></B>whenever possible. The penalty fees that
dive resorts, airlines &amp; wholesalers charge are a major hassle. Best
to be sure before you book. Of course, if you have a legitimate family
emergency, as defined by USDT's <I>Terms &amp; Conditions</I> (Click on
&quot;How to Book a Trip&quot; on the Home Page) we'll work with you --
when you're forced to cancel your dive resort or liveaboard vacation for dire reasons completely beyond your control.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">7.</FONT></B> Be sure
to line up all your <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">necessary documentation</FONT></B>
well in advance of departure. Don't forget to bring: passport, visa if
required, diver certification card, DAN or PADI emergency insurance card,
driver's license &amp; extra cash. <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Important note
to all parents traveling with minor children</FONT></B>: Until a child
is 18 years old, U.S. law requires that the child must have a permission
slip, signed by each parent, &amp; formally notarized, before leaving the
country. For example in a divorce situation, if only one parent is traveling
with a minor child, the other parent must sign &amp; notarize a formal
permission letter before that child is allowed to leave the U.S. This federal
law aims to prevent abductions that stem from gnarly custody battles.</FONT>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">8.</FONT></B> Carry
your credit cards, driver's license, certification card &amp; passport
in a <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">concealed pouch </FONT></B>beneath your clothing.
Carry your cash or traveler's checks in a waist-band <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">money
belt</FONT></B>. Never flash your cash. Don't wear bright, gaudy
jewelry or watches, a surefire magnet for muggers abroad. Always remove your cash
stash from the secret belt in a lavatory or private hotel room -- never
in public view.  This is a MUST-DO rule for any smart dive resort or liveaboard vacation.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">9.</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Pack
light.</FONT></B> For trips of two weeks or less, all you need is one medium-sized
duffel-bag or dive bag checked through &amp; one small carry-on pouch the
size of a gym bag. Keep the checked-through bag less than 50 lb. to be
sure the island hopper airline will take it. Always carry your regulator
assembly, your dive computer, eyeglasses &amp; personal essentials with
you on the plane. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">10.</FONT></B> Carry
a list of <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">emergency phone numbers &amp; addresses</FONT></B>
(back home) with you. Leave your full itinerary with somebody you trust
here stateside, as a conscientious backup to your dive resort or liveaboard vacation.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">11.</FONT></B> For extended
expedition-style trips, when you reach the main city of your host country,
<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">check in with the U.S. Consulate </FONT></B>to
alert them to your travel plans, especially the dates &amp; places you'll
visit. They're an invaluable backup to any dive resort or liveaboard trip.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">12.</FONT></B> Please
<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">NEVER mess with any form of drugs </FONT></B>overseas.
You are risking your life &amp; freedom for a worthless, empty moment of escape.
Police &amp; courts in Third World destinations, such as Singapore, can
be ruthless with drug abusers. The U.S. Customs Service will come down
on you like a ton of bricks if you try smuggling. And you will deserve
every iota of grief that comes your way. Taking chances with drug use is
simply the most destructive &amp; idiotic thing any dive traveler can do,
anywhere. You are putting your health (on scuba) &amp; your future on the
line for a few meaningless puffs or tablets. Why wreck a perfectly excellent 
dive resort or liveaboard vacation with such a moronic moment?   If you need to bring prescription medicines
into another country, better to be safe than sorry. Make sure you have
duplicate copies of a doctor's signed authorization letter plus the formal
prescription sheet to show customs officials. End of sermon. Heed it.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">13. </FONT></B>Bring
a wad of <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">small bills ($5, $10, $20)</FONT></B>
for tips &amp; hurry-up purchases. U.S. currency is welcomed anywhere in
the Americas, &amp; in many other countries too.  Fun little factoid: $2 bills from the USA are 
legal tender of course, anywhere in the Americas, but folks in lesser-developed nations almost 
never see them.  So $2 bills make great tips, since they are not only a day's wages for many workers around the world, but they also are a curiosity piece that invariable triggers friendly smiles. We have used this simple little trick on many dive resort &  liveaboard vacations.  Works like a charm!</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">14. Consult USDT's comprehensive
dive travel checklists</FONT></B> for the many details that make a trip
safe &amp; easy. These are little items you might overlook; but they can
prove to be important if you're ever in a pickle overseas. (See &quot;How
to Book a Trip&quot; on the Home Page.)</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">15.</FONT></B> Make
sure you have at least three months of <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">cardio-vascular
conditioning &amp; athletic stretching </FONT></B>under your belt before
the trip, so you have the vim to handle strong currents or possible diving
emergencies underwater or at the surface in heavy waves. A good foundation
of exercise, along with proper sleep, good hydration &amp; prudent use
of alcohol, will greatly reduce your chances of decompression sickness. 
If you are a heavy smoker, or if you have had open-heart surgery, or if you suffer from 
serious diabetes, asthma or panic disorder, better not even think of scuba diving. 
You are playing Russian Roulette with your life.  Get your MD's informed opinion first before investing in any serious dive resort or liveaboard vacation.</FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">16.</FONT></B> Bring
a few <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">small gifts</FONT></B> to help grease the
skids when you need to thank a foreign friend, or to ingratiate yourself
with officials overseas. Pens, hard candy, gum, color postcards from your
hometown, cheap digital watches &amp; tape cassettes are excellent socio-political
lubricants &amp; are universally appreciated. Also bring small hard-to-get
items that are cheap stateside but dear abroad, such as medicines, toiletries,
compact snacks (dried fruits &amp; nuts), books &amp; film. </FONT><BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">17.</FONT></B> Get a
<B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">good guidebook</FONT></B> before you leave the
U.S. to learn more about customs, climate, currency, cuisine &amp; such.
We do recommend the Lonely Planet series of travel guides. They are
non-pedantic, non-patronizing, frequently, though not always, accurate
&amp; generally quite respectful to all cultures. Best of luck in planning, & enjoying, your 
dive resort or liveaboard vacation.</FONT><BR>
