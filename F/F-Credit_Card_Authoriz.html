<P>in the amount of $_______________________ . By this credit card document 
I hereby give my complete approval to pay in full for all specific services

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">IMPORTANT NOTICE of DISCOUNT WAIVER:</FONT> </B>

I understand that by approving this credit card 
booking, I am freely consenting to a waiver of U.S. Dive Travel's 5% inherent discount, which is built 
into the normal prices for all travel service that USDT advertises &amp; sells.  This rule holds for all hotels, lodges, 
dive resorts, live-aboards, side tours, guide services, international 
airline tickets, island hopper air tickets -- any &amp; all vacation-related services -- that I wish to pay for via 
Visa or Mastercard.  I therefore understand that by freely waiving this 5% 
inherent discount, I am adding 5% to my total vacation package price, when I pay U.S. Dive Travel with a 
Visa or Mastercard credit card.  This waiver of the USDT cash discount covers the costly service fees that 
the national banks &amp; credit card companies, &amp; third-party brokers who administer these card debits, routinely charge for merchant services.

<B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">I ACCEPT the U.S. DIVE TRAVEL<BR> 
CANCELLATION POLICY:</FONT> <BR>
</FONT></B>By my notarized signature here below I freely agree that this
U.S. Dive Travel vacation booking is a legally binding contract &amp; not
merely a recital. And I further agree by my notarized signature here below
to forever waive my right, &amp; forfeit my ability, to later refuse payment
on this credit card charge. I further agree to abide by all of USDT's trip
cancellation policies, as expressed clearly in the Terms &amp; Conditions included
in this Internet site. </P>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">I WAIVE MY RIGHTS to CONTEST <BR>
USDT PENALTY FEES if I CANCEL:</FONT> <BR>
</FONT></B>Further, by my notarized signature here below I fully &amp;
freely accept all restrictions, rules, debits &amp; penalty fees that any
airline, or provider of land lodging, or any vessel company or dive operation,
or any tour company or rental vehicle company, or any bank or associate
company of USDT will impose upon me should I seek to cancel this credit
card payment. I realize that these above-listed companies all have their
own Terms &amp; Conditions for vacation bookings &amp; that these rules
are beyond USDT's ability to change or control. I further realize that
any &amp; all vacation package cancellations that I initiate later than
75 days before my trip departure likely will result in strict penalty fees. Therefore
I further agree, if I cancel, to freely forfeit that portion of my payment
to USDT, as required by USDT's Terms &amp; Conditions.<BR>
</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">I WAIVE MY RIGHT to CONTEST<BR> 
CHANGE FEES or USDT REFUND POLICIES:</FONT> <BR>
</FONT></B>Further, by my notarized signature here below, I acknowledge
that airlines might impose substantial change fees if I try to make alterations
in vacation dates or itinerary once an air ticket has been booked &amp;
paid for. I fully accept this reality of the airline industry &amp; I agree
not to contest any such airline penalty fees for any schedule changes I
request after the original ticketing. I further accept that when I've booked
through USDT, most hotels &amp; resorts, cruise vessels &amp; dive
operations, as well as tour companies represented by USDT, will not refund
my payments after my cancellation. Instead, depending on the facts behind my cancellation, 
these companies may offer
me a voucher authorizing a new &amp; identical vacation trip that starts
no later than one calendar year after my original departure date. Therefore
I freely &amp; fully accept these USDT rules for trip changes, cancellation
&amp; refunds. And I further agree not to contest any refusal by USDT,
or by any vacation service providers (ie. hotels, resorts, dive operations,
airlines &amp; tour companies, etc.) to refund my money in cash, or by
credit card charge reversals, if I try to cancel, or if I request to cancel any portion of this USDT
booking. </P>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">I AGREE to ALL of U.S. DIVE TRAVEL'S<BR>
TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS of BOOKING:</FONT> <BR>
</FONT></B>Further, by my notarized signature here below, I hereby acknowledge
that I have read in full, &amp; I freely consent to &amp;  agree with
all provisions of U.S. Dive Travel's Terms &amp; Conditions for vacation
bookings -- a document that is included on this Internet site. Further,
I agree that my complete acceptance of all said Terms &amp; Conditions
is binding &amp; contractual, is not merely a recital, &amp; is final.
Therefore I forever hold harmless, discharge &amp; release U.S. Dive Travel 
&amp; also John &amp; Susan Hessburg, from any &amp; all forms of litigation,
legal actions, causes of action, claims, debts or demands of every nature
related to my cancellation of, or changes to, any portion of this credit
card booking. I further extend this entire release to cover, now &amp; in the future, 
all of the above agencies' owners, agents, employees, family members,
representatives, contractors &amp; sub-contractors, &amp; all banks &amp;
financial institutions that process my credit card payment.  
All terms &amp; conditions in this agreement shall be interpreted, construed &amp; enforced 
according to the laws of the State of Minnesota, USA.
