<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">This special PADI medical form is NOT required

of all U.S. Dive Travel (USDT) clients. Rather, the only clients whom we

ask to fill out this form ( &amp; return it to USDT ) are those persons

who already know, or suspect, that they have one or more serious medical conditions

that might affect their personal safety while scuba diving.</FONT></B></P>



<P>U.S. Dive Travel has only one motive in providing this PADI form --

not to meddle or annoy -- but only to increase your diving safety margin

to the very highest degree possible. That's because we truly care about

the health &amp; well-being of our clients. After all, we consider you

friends first, then business associates later. That is the U.S. Dive Travel

way of doing business.</P>



<P>So please be fully frank with us about your medical history. Please

do not conceal any serious or chronic medical conditions you know to exist.

We promise to work with you as closely as possible, in case there are questions,

to help you take your vacation as planned -- if that is medically allowed

by your personal doctor or the physicians examining you. With these rules in place, we all can do the best

&amp; safest job possible in planning your dive vacation. Thank you very

much for your time &amp; consideration.</P>

involved in scuba diving. Your signature on this statement is required

in order to participate in the scuba excursion offered by (your dive vacation planning company)

<P>Read and discuss this statement prior to signing it. You must complete

this Scuba Diving Medical Statement, which includes the medical history

section, to participate in the scuba excursion. If you are a minor, you

must have the Scuba Diving Medical Statement signed by a parent or guardian.</P>



<P>Scuba diving is an exciting and demanding activity. When performed correctly,

applying correct techniques, it is very safe. When established safety procedures

are not followed, however, there are dangers. To scuba dive safely, you

must not be extremely overweight or out of condition. Diving can be strenuous

under certain conditions. Your respiratory &amp; circulatory systems must

be in good health. All body air spaces must be normal and healthy. A person

with heart trouble, a current cold or congestion, epilepsy, asthma, a severe

medical problem, or who is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, should

not dive. If taking medication, consult your doctor before participating

in scuba diving.</P>



<P>If you have any additional questions regarding this Scuba Diving Medical

Statement, review them with the excursion operator before signing.</P>

<P>To the Diver:</P>



<P>The purpose of this medical questionnaire is to find out if you should

be examined by your doctor before participating in recreational scuba diving.

A positive response to a question does not necessarily disqualify you from

diving. A positive response means that there is a pre-existing condition

that may affect your safety while diving and you must seek the advice of

your physician.</P>



<P>Please answer the following questions on your past or present medical

history with a <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">YES</FONT></B> or <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">NO</FONT></B>.

If you are not sure, answer <B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">YES</FONT></B>. If

any of these items apply to you, we must request that you consult with

a physician prior to participating in scuba diving. Your excursion operator

/ coordinator will supply you with a PADI Medical Statement and Guidelines

for Recreational Scuba Diver's Physical Examination to take to your physician.</P>
