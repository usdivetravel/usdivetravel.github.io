CLIENT PRINTS FULL LEGAL NAME HERE</FONT> </P>



<P>by my signatures on all four sections of this liability release &amp;

waiver document, do hereby verify that I am a client of U.S. Dive Travel. 

I also agree &amp; affirm that by requiring me to 

read &amp; sign all four sections of this liability release &amp; waiver,

U.S. Dive Travel has thoroughly &amp; responsibly advised me about the

hazards &amp; risks of scuba diving, snorkeling &amp; skin diving (free diving without scuba) associated with this

dive trip. Throughout this entire document, &quot;dive trip&quot; will be defined

to mean this particular upcoming tropical vacation package (any scuba trip or 

non-scuba trip), which is sold to

the above-named client by U.S. Dive Travel (hereafter in this document

referred to as USDT) such that the client runs his or her own vacation

with no USDT staff personally guiding them overseas. As a properly certified scuba

diver (or a skin diver/snorkeler) who has a thorough understanding of the accepted

rules for safe &amp; responsible diving, I hereby affirm that I completely understand

&amp; agree with all of the following facts &amp; USDT advisories: </P>



<UL>

<LI>That scuba diving &amp; snorkeling (also known as skin diving or free diving) are physically strenuous sports

that require me to be in excellent health &amp; physical condition in order

to safely perform them; &amp; that when safe-diving rules are followed


conscientiously, as I have been trained to do, scuba diving &amp; snorkeling are exciting &amp; enjoyable

adventure sports that offer many lasting rewards to me.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>That breathing compressed air underwater through a regulator, on this

upcoming USDT dive trip, involves medical risks &amp; the possibility that

I may sustain serious or fatal injuries, or debilitating medical conditions,

from accidental or unforeseen events including but not limited to coronary

&amp; cerebral air embolism, ruptured-lung injuries such as mediastinal

emphysema &amp; subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax (collapsed lungs)

&amp; decompression sickness (commonly known as &quot;The Bends&quot;).<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>That scuba diving, snorkeling &amp; skin diving in tropical ocean waters, on this

upcoming USDT dive trip, also carry the risk that I may sustain serious

or fatal injuries, or debilitating medical conditions, from heat stroke,

heat exhaustion, hypothermia, tropical infections, tropical illnesses such

as malaria, &amp; other harmful events that relate directly to my health.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>That scuba diving, snorkeling &amp; skin diving in tropical ocean waters, on this

upcoming USDT dive trip, also carry the risk that my acquatic gear &amp;

other personal property such as underwater cameras may be damaged, plus the risk that I may sustain

serious or fatal injuries from natural forces beyond any human control.

Such forces include but are not limited to deepwater or shoreline currents,

tidal currents, ocean surge, high swells &amp; waves, breaking surf, riptides,

storms of any kind that may sink oceangoing vessels, &amp; unforeseen natural

disasters such as typhoons or floods, &amp; the aftermath of such disasters.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>That scuba diving, snorkeling &amp; skin diving in tropical ocean waters, on this

upcoming USDT dive trip, also carry the risk that I may sustain serious

or fatal injuries from marine life forms such as sharks of various species,

barracudas, aggressive pelagic fish, jellyfish, Portuguese Man-of-War organisms,

lionfish, turkeyfish, scorpionfish, stonefish, stingrays or skates, cone

shells, sea urchins, sea snakes, moray eels &amp; other eel species, crown-of-thorns

sea stars, fire corals, various other species of corals &amp; many other

types of venomous marine flora &amp; fauna.<BR>

<BR>

</LI>



<LI>That while I'm scuba diving or snorkeling or skin diving on this USDT dive trip I may be in a remote location,

which might be several days removed from the nearest hospital or recompression

chamber; &amp; therefore it may not be possible to quickly evacuate me

in the event that I experience a severe dive-related mishap such as a lung-expansion

injury or decompression sickness. I fully understand &amp; accept these

risks &amp; dangers of overseas scuba diving, snorkeling &amp; skin diving on this upcoming USDT dive

trip.</LI>

</UL>



<P>Because USDT has given me a thorough &amp; good faith introduction to

the risks &amp; hazards that exist when I scuba dive, snorkel or skin dive anywhere, especially in

remote or isolated areas on this upcoming USDT dive trip, I hereby affirm

that I freely assume all responsibility whatsoever for any &amp; all health

&amp; medical risks, &amp; also for any &amp; all accidents, mishaps, property

damage, monetary loss, injuries, loss of life, or any other harmful events

associated with this upcoming USDT dive trip, which might befall me.</P>
